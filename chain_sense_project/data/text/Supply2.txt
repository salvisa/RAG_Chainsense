ABSTRACT: As climate change accelerates, the frequency and severity of extreme weather events are
expected to worsen and have greater adverse consequences for ecosystems, physical infrastructure, and
economic activity across the world. This paper investigates how weather anomalies affect global supply chains
and inflation dynamics. Using monthly data for six large and well-diversified economies (China, the Euro area,
Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States) over the period 1997-2021, we implement a
structural vector autoregressive model and document that weather anomalies could disrupt supply chains and
subsequently lead to inflationary pressures. Our results—based on high-frequency data and robust to
alternative estimation methodologies—show that these effects vary across countries, depending on the severity
of weather shocks and vulnerability to supply chain disruptions. The impact of weather shocks on supply chains
and inflation dynamics is likely to become more pronounced with accelerating climate change that can have
non-linear effects. These findings have important policy implications. Central bankers should consider the
impact of weather anomalies on supply chains and inflation dynamics to prevent entrenching second-round
effects and de-anchoring of inflation expectations. More directly, however, governments can invest more for
climate change adaptation to strengthen critical infrastructure and thereby minimize supply chain disruptions.

This Is Going to Hurt: Climate Change, Supply Chain Pressures and Inflation

Executive Summary
The world economy has experienced a series of unprecedented shocks over the past three years, disrupting
supply chains, causing a deep recession, and pushing inflation to the highest level since the 1970s. While
inflation is on a downward trajectory with economic activity on the mend, vulnerabilities persist. One of the most
significant risks to the global economy and financial markets is climate change. As human-induced climate
change accelerates over the coming decades, greater frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions
can have far-reaching adverse consequences for physical infrastructure and economic activity. There is
convincing evidence that climate-related natural disasters have significant effects on inflation and economic
growth. An important channel of this relationship is the impact of weather anomalies—caused by climate
change—on global supply chains in the production and distribution of goods and services. Disruptions during
the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing sharp increase in global inflation have highlighted the importance of
risks to the complex and interdependent network of supply chains across the world. With rising global
temperatures, extreme weather events stress transportation infrastructure and highly connected global supply
chains, interrupting production, causing shortages, and leading to higher prices.
Demand-side factors certainly play a significant role in driving inflation, but this paper aims to close an
important gap in the literature by investigating the impact of weather anomalies on global supply chains and
inflation dynamics. Using monthly data covering six large and well-diversified economies—China, the Euro
area, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States—over the period 1997-2021, we implement a
structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model and trace the contemporaneous effects of weather anomalies
on supply chains and inflation dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in the literature
to investigate the impact of weather shocks on supply chain pressures and alternative measures of inflation
using a SVAR model, which offers insights on how climate change could affect global supply networks and
inflation dynamics beyond the sample of countries used in the analysis. For robustness, we also implement the
local projection (LP) method to trace the dynamic effects of temperature anomalies on supply chains and
inflation over time.
We find that weather anomalies could contribute to supply chain disruptions and subsequently lead to
inflationary pressures. Our results—based on high-frequency data and robust to alternative estimation
methodologies—show significant heterogeneity across countries in the sample, which we attribute to
differences in the severity of weather shocks and vulnerability to supply chain disruptions. The impact of
weather shocks on supply chains and inflation dynamics is likely to become more pronounced with accelerating
climate change that can have non-linear effects. Although our empirical results do not always show a strong
positive link between weather shocks and supply chain disruptions, due to, in part, the use of aggregated
supply-side disruptions, this does not imply that we can be complacent about increasing weather anomalies.
For instance, a severe drought has reduced water level considerably in Panama Canal, disrupting trade route
connecting Asia and North America. Our results have important policy implications. Central bankers should
consider the persistent impact of weather anomalies on supply chains and inflation dynamics to prevent
entrenching second-round effects and de-anchoring inflation expectations. More directly, however,
governments can invest more for climate change adaptation to strengthen critical infrastructure and thereby
minimize supply chain disruptions.

This Is Going to Hurt: Climate Change, Supply Chain Pressures and Inflation

Introduction

The world economy has experienced a multitude of shocks in recent years, disrupting global supply chains,
causing a deep recession, and pushing inflation to the highest level since the 1970s. While inflation is on the
decline from its peak of 11.6 percent in 2022 to 5.3 percent in 2023, long-term vulnerabilities persist. One of the
most significant risks to the global economy and financial markets is climate change. The increase in the global
land temperature has reached more than 1.1 degrees Celsius (°C) compared with the preindustrial average,
before human-induced climate change began to take effect (Figure 1).1 Projections show that accelerating
climate change will raise the mean temperature above the 1.5°C threshold in the near term and by as much as
4°C over the next century absent a global green transition. As climate change accelerates over the coming
decades, greater frequency and severity of acute weather events can have far-reaching adverse consequences
for physical infrastructure and economic activity (Stern 2007; IPCC 2007, 2014, 2019; 2021). There is
convincing evidence that show climate-related natural disasters having significant effects on inflation and
growth (Cevik and Jalles, 2023). An important channel of transmission in this context is the complex and
interdependent network of supply chains across the world, as shown by disruptions during the COVID-19
pandemic (Bonadio et al., 2021; Binici et al., 2022; Celasun et al., 2022; Santacreu and LaBelle, 2022). With
rising temperatures, extreme weather conditions will stress transportation infrastructure and highly-connected
global supply chains—interrupting production, causing shortages, and leading to higher prices.2

The average global temperature in 2023 was already about 1.5°C warmer than that of the pre-industrial period. However, a
temporary increase of 1.5°C is different from the Paris Agreement target of limiting long-term global warming to 1.5°C by 2100.

Supply chain disruptions persisting a month or longer already occur every 3.7 years on average (Lund et al., 2020). These
disruptions are not just caused by hurricanes and tornadoes, but also by severe drought due to intense heat waves, for example, in
the Panama Canal and the Rhine river, which are the only passageway for container vessels between the Atlantic and Pacific
oceans and one of the most important inland waterways in Europe, respectively. Carriere-Swallow et al. (2023) find that higher
shipping costs due to supply chain disruptions have a significant effect on domestic inflation in a sample of 46 countries.

This Is Going to Hurt: Climate Change, Supply Chain Pressures and Inflation

Conceptually, the effects of weather anomalies, as measured by unseasonal temperature deviations in this
paper, can evolve through different direct and indirect transmission mechanisms, with opposing effects
simultaneously on demand and supply (Somanathan et al., 2021; Cevik and Jalles, 2023; Ciccarelli, Kuik, and
Hernández, 2023). First, weather shocks can result in higher energy demand and prices, which could in turn
lead to second-round effects on non-energy prices across the economy. Second, large weather fluctuations
can lower individual productivity in climate-sensitive sectors of the economy and alter inflation dynamics. Third,
weather shocks can cause supply chain disruptions, instigating a productivity shortfall, increasing the cost of
transportation and production, and consequently contributing to higher inflation. In this complex context, we
examine how the increasing frequency and severity of weather anomalies affect supply chains and inflation
dynamics (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Transmission of Temperature Shocks

This paper aims to close an important void in the literature by providing an empirical analysis of how weather
anomalies—measured by unseasonal deviation in temperature from the historical average—affect supply chain
pressures and inflation dynamics. Using monthly data covering six large economies—China, the Euro area,
Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States—over the period 1997-2021, we estimate a set of
structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models for each country in the sample and trace the contemporaneous
effects of weather shocks on country-specific supply chain pressures and inflation. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt in the literature to investigate the impact of temperature anomalies on supply
chain disruptions and alternative measures of inflation using a SVAR model, which offers insights on how
climate change could affect global supply networks and inflation dynamics beyond the sample of countries
used in the analysis. For robustness, we also implement the local projection (LP) method to trace the dynamic
effects of temperature anomalies on supply chains and inflation dynamics over time.
We find that weather anomalies could disrupt supply chains and subsequently lead to inflationary pressures.
Our results—based on high-frequency data and robust to alternative estimation methodologies—show
significant heterogeneity across countries in the sample, which we attribute to differences in the severity of
weather shocks and vulnerability to supply chain disruptions. The impact of weather shocks on supply chains
and inflation dynamics is likely to become more pronounced with accelerating climate change that can have
non-linear effects. Although our empirical results do not always show a strong positive link between weather
shocks and supply chain disruptions, due to, in part, the use of aggregated supply-side disruptions, this does
not imply that we can be complacent about increasing weather anomalies. For instance, a severe drought has
reduced water level considerably in Panama Canal, disrupting trade route connecting Asia and North America.
Our results have important policy implications. Central bankers should consider the persistent impact of
weather anomalies on supply chains and inflation dynamics to prevent entrenching second-round effects and

de-anchoring inflation expectations. More directly, however, governments can invest more for climate change
adaptation to strengthen critical infrastructure and thereby minimize supply chain disruptions.
The remainder of this study is structured as follows. Section II describes the data used in the analysis. Section
III introduces the salient features of our econometric strategy and presents the empirical results. Finally,
Section IV offers concluding remarks with policy implications.

II. Literature Review
This paper contributes to a growing branch of the literature focusing on the impact of climate change on
economic activity and financial markets.3 Starting with Nordhaus (1991; 1992) and Cline (1992), aggregate
damage functions are widely used to analyze the relationship between climatic conditions and economic
developments. Although the identification of macroeconomic effects of annual variation in climatic conditions is
a difficult empirical undertaking, Gallup, Sachs, and Mellinger (1999), Nordhaus (2006), and Dell, Jones, and
Olken (2012) observe that higher temperatures result in a significant reduction in economic growth in
developing countries. Burke, Hsiang, and Miguel (2015) corroborate this finding and determine that higher
temperatures would have a greater damage in countries that are concentrated in geographic areas with hotter
climates. Using large datasets, Acevedo et al. (2018), Burke and Tanutama (2019), Kahn et al. (2021), and
Akyapi, Bellon, and Massetti (2022) show that the long-term economic impact of weather anomalies, such as
persistent changes in the temperature above or below the historical norm, is not homogenous across countries
and that economic growth responds nonlinearly to extreme temperature.
It is also well documented that increasing frequency and severity of climate-related natural disasters affect
economic development (Loyaza et al., 2012; Noy, 2009; Raddatz, 2009; Skidmore and Toya, 2002), reduce the
accumulation of human capital (Cuaresma, 2010) and worsen external balances (Gassebner, Kesk, and The,
2006). More recently, Cevik and Jalles (2020; 2021; 2022) show that climate change vulnerability has
significant effects on the cost of government borrowing and the probability of sovereign debt default, especially
in developing countries. Similarly, Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa (2016) and IMF (2020) find that risks associated
with climate change—as proxied by temperature increases—have a negative effect on asset valuations, while
Bernstein, Gustasson, and Lewis (2019) show that real estate exposed to the risk of sea level rise is priced at a
discount relative to otherwise similar unexposed houses. Focusing on the U.S., Painter (2020) finds that
counties more likely to be affected by climate change pay more in underwriting fees and initial yields to issue
long-term municipal bonds compared to counties unlikely to be affected by climate change.
There is a small but growing literature on the impact of climate change on consumer price inflation. A few
studies look at the impact of natural hazards on prices (Parker, 2018; Heinen, Khadan, and Strobl, 2019), while
there is almost no research on the effect of extreme weather events including temperature deviations, apart
from studies focusing on specific sectors of activity (De Winne and Peersman, 2021) or a single country (Kim,
Matthes, and Phan, 2022). Studying how extreme temperatures affect various measures of inflation in 48
advanced and emerging economies during the period 1951–1980, Faccia, Parker, and Stracca (2021) find that
higher temperatures play a non-negligible role in driving price developments, especially for emerging market
economies. Similarly, Kabundi, Mlachila, and Yao (2022) analyze how climate shocks affect consumer prices

and find that the impact depends on the type and intensity of shocks, the level of income, and the type of
monetary policy regime. Finally, in a recent study covering 173 countries over the period from 1970 to 2020,
Cevik and Jalles (2023) show that climate-related natural disasters have significant effects on consumer price
inflation and economic growth.
The literature on supply chain pressures and inflation is limited, but also growing fast after the COVID-19
pandemic. Benigno et al. (2022) introduces a new index of global supply chain pressures and find a significant
effect on inflation during the pandemic period. With a model-based approach, Di Giovanni et al. (2022) shows
that supply bottlenecks in international trade contribute to higher inflation. Using data from international
container trade, Finck and Tillmann (2022) find that global supply chain disruptions caused by the Tohoku
earthquake in 2011, the Suez Canal obstruction in 2021, and the Shanghai backlog in 2022 caused a decline in
real economic activity and an increase in consumer prices in the euro area. LaBelle and Santacreu (2022)
analyze the effect of supply chain pressures on producer prices in the US and conclude that about one-fifth of
the producer price inflation. Likewise, Kabaca and Tuzcuoglu (2023) analyze the contribution of supply-side
forces to consumer price inflation in the US and show that global supply chain and oil price shocks are the most
principal factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a panel of 29 sub-Saharan African countries,
Andriantomanga, Bolhuis, and Hakobyan (2023) find that an increase in global supply chain pressures leads to
a significant increase in consumer price inflation.

III. Data Overview
The vector of endogenous variables includes three variables: weather anomalies, supply chain pressures and
consumer price inflation. We assemble a dataset of monthly observations covering six countries (China, the
Euro area, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States) over the period 1997–2021. The sample
selection is determined by the availability of country-specific data on supply chain pressures. Inflation is
computed as the year-on-year percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as follows:

𝜋𝑖,𝑡 = (

𝐶𝑃𝐼𝑖,𝑡

𝐶𝑃𝐼𝑖,𝑡−12

) ∗ 100

(1)

where 𝜋𝑖,𝑡 denotes inflation in country i at time t based on headline CPI or core CPI, drawn from the World
Bank’s global database of inflation (Ha, Kose, and Ohnsorge, 2023). To mitigate outliers and handle the
possible negative values of inflation, we resort to an inverse hyperbolic sine transformation, i.e.,
2
ln (𝜋𝑖,𝑡 + √𝜋𝑖,𝑡
+ 1).

We measure country-specific supply chain disruptions with the Supply Chain Pressures Index (SCPI)
constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (Benigno et al., 2022). The SCPI is a novel measure of
supply chain pressures based on monthly information from 27 indicators including international transportation
costs, port congestions, shortage of containers and drivers, and supply chain-related components of the
Purchasing Managers’ Index surveys for manufacturing firms. The SCPI is measured in standard deviations
from the sample average and normalized to have an average value of zero over the full time series.
Accordingly, a reading above zero implies an increase in supply chain disruptions relative to the average.
Weather anomalies are measured as a deviation of monthly mean temperature from the historical average,
which are obtained from the World Bank’s Climate Change Knowledge Portal. We follow the literature and

IMF WORKING PAPERS

calculate monthly deviations in temperature as 𝑇𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑇𝑖,𝑡 − 𝑇𝑖,(𝑡) in country i at time t. In other words, weather
anomalies are derived from the difference between the temperature observation at time t and the historical
average for that month during the reference period of 1901-1996. Given that the SCPI begins in 1997, we
choose the reference year for weather anomalies from 1996 backward. For the Euro area, we aggregate 19
countries to calculate a GDP-weighted average series of temperature deviations to account for the differences
in country size. To develop a more granular analysis, we also focus on extreme weather events defined as an
anomaly that is large relative to historical variation.
Descriptive statistics, presented in Table 1, show significant variation across countries and over time. First, we
observe that the deviation of monthly mean temperature from its historical average ranges from 0.86°C in the
United Kingdom to 1.26°C in Japan, with an upward trend across all countries. Second, supply chain pressures
as measured by the SCPI vary from -0.02 in Japan to -0.01 in the Euro Area. Third, headline inflation moves
from an average of 0.06 percent in Japan to 1.49 percent in Korea, while core inflation stands at -0.11 percent
in Japan and 1.44 percent in the United States.
For the appropriate implementation of the SVAR model, it is necessary to analyze the time-series properties of
the data to avoid spurious results. The stationarity of all variables is checked by applying the augmented
Dickey-Fuller (1981), which is widely used in literature. These results, presented in Appendix Table A1, indicate
that all series are stationary after logarithmic transformation.

IV. Econometric Strategy
The empirical objective of this paper is to estimate the impact of weather anomalies—as measured by
temperature deviations—on supply chain disruptions and alternative measures of inflation, using monthly data
covering six large economies (China, the Euro area, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States)
over the period 1997–2021. To gain better insights into the dynamic relationship between climate change,
supply chain disruptions and alternative measures of inflation, we implement a three-variable SVAR model and
resort to the Cholesky decomposition to orthogonalize the reduced-form residuals that impose causal chains in
this framework.
We are interested in how temperature shocks affect supply chains and inflation dynamics, which are also partly
determined by supply chain disruptions. In our SVAR framework, we assume that temperature anomalies are
strictly exogenous, and that no variable could influence the weather variable. One may argue that temperature
anomalies are indeed an outcome of human activity, but the anthropogenic impact on weather anomalies is a
slow-moving process over centuries (Ciccarelli, Kuik, and Hernández, 2023). Given that our focus is the shortrun effect of temperature shocks on supply chain pressures and inflation, it is less likely that supply chain
pressures and inflation affect weather anomalies. Our identification of temperature shocks is based on the idea
that weather anomalies cause supply chain disruptions that lead to changes in transportation costs and crossborder shipment quantities. Accordingly, in this paper, we use the identification assumption that weather
anomalies cause supply chain disruptions that in turn reduce the supply of goods and services and lead to
higher inflation. We estimate the AB model SVAR specification for each country separately as follows
(Lütkepohl, 2005):
(2)

𝑝

𝐴𝑋𝑡 = ∑𝑗=1 Π𝑗 𝑋𝑡−𝑗 + 𝐵𝜀𝑡

in which 𝑋𝑡 is a 3 x 1 vector of endogenous variables including weather anomalies (as measured by
temperature deviations), the country-specific SCPI and headline or core inflation, subject to an inverse
hyperbolic sine transformation, at time t. 𝜀𝑡 is an independent and identically distributed random vector with
variance equal to the identity matrix of dimension of 3. We omit constant for simplicity. Under these restrictions,
we specify the SVAR model with the 3x3 matrix as below:

𝐴 = [0

V. Empirical Results
In this section, we provide a visual presentation of the impulse response of supply chain pressures and inflation
to temperature shocks in terms of one standard deviation over the 24-month horizon, together with
corresponding 68 percent confidence intervals.4 In Figure 7, we begin with the impact of weather shocks on
supply chain pressures in six economies that we analyze. These results indicate that a larger temperature
deviation with respect to the historical average tends to exert upward pressure on supply chain pressures. The
estimated coefficients are economically intuitive, but not statistically significant for all countries in the sample.
Quantitatively, we find that a 1°C increase in temperature with respect to historical average increases supply
chain pressures by roughly 0.3 and 0.6 standard deviation after 2 years in China, Korea and the United States,
respectively. On the other hand, the impact of weather shocks on supply chain pressures appears to be
negligible in the Euro Area, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Altogether, these findings confirm that weather
shocks could cause greater supply chain disruptions in a non-linear fashion as climate change accelerates.
It is also important to highlight the components forming the supply chain pressures. As described in the
previous section, the SCPI is constructed based on shipping rates, air freight prices, and the sub-components
of the PMI, such as delivery time, backlogs, and purchased stocks. These components tend to be affected
more by, for instance, oil price fluctuations and port congestion that have a direct influence on supply chain
pressures. Thus, the share of weather shocks explaining supply chain pressures might be smaller than what
we would have expected. In addition, our results may have been contaminated by the unprecedented COVID19 pandemic period, which we exclude as a robustness check in the next section.
In Figures 8 and 9, we present the impact of supply chain pressures on headline and core inflation,
respectively, in each economy. There is a clear upward pressure on headline inflation across all countries,
except Korea. Quantitatively, a one-standard deviation shock of supply chain pressures on inflation is
associated with large and persistent increases in headline inflation in China, the United Kingdom and the
United States, amounting to about 1.3 percent, 0.7 percent, and 1.5 percent, respectively, over the 24-month
period. The magnitude of this supply-chain effect on headline inflation is significantly smaller in the Euro Area
and Japan, and supply chain pressures do not appear to have an adverse effect in the case of Korea.
However, we should note that inflation in Korea may have been affected to a significant extent by the Asian
financial crisis (1997-1999) that disrupted supply chains. After excluding the Asian financial crisis and the
COVID-19 pandemic, we find that greater supply chain pressures lead to higher inflation in Korea (Appendix
Figure 1A). We also observe that the impact of supply chain disruptions on core inflation follows a similar
pattern (except for Japan), with considerably lower estimated coefficients (except for the United States).

Finally, in Figures 10 and 11, we present the direct impact of weather shocks on headline and core inflation,
respectively, for each economy separately. These statistically insignificant results yield an ambiguous picture of
the relationship between temperature shocks and inflation dynamics. This should not be surprising since our
sample consists of six large and well-diversified economies where inflation dynamics are shaped by more
powerful domestic and global factors. It is also important to note that higher temperatures may have a positive
effect on agricultural output and depress energy demand, which in turn lowers inflation pressures. As Lucidi et
al. (2022) argue, warmer winters decrease energy demand more than warmer summers raise it. Therefore, a
decline in inflation could result from reduced energy demand. Nevertheless, with accelerating climate change,
there is also an increase in the volatility of weather patterns, which we find to be associated with supply chain
disruptions and consequently higher inflation.

VI. Robustness Checks
To check the robustness of our baseline results, we estimate the model (i) for a panel of six countries in our
sample, (ii) for the periods excluding the COVID-19 pandemic and pre- and post-global financial crisis, (iii)
using the cyclical component of inflation.
First, we implement the LP method developed by Jordà (2005) to capture the dynamic effects of temperature
anomalies on supply chains and inflation over time in a panel setting. The LP approach is a flexible alternative
to SVAR vector as it does not constrain the shape of IRFs. We follow our previous causal chains for the panel
LP estimations. Figure 12 displays that supply chain pressures exert upward pressure on headline inflation,
which is consistent with our previous results and our intuitions. We see a sharp rise in headline inflation
induced by supply chain pressures, and it declines rapidly after one year. This indicates that supply-side
shocks are not persistent in five large countries and the Euro Area. In contrast, temperature shocks rather
reduce inflation, which aligns with our previous results. In addition, we have dropped the COVID-19 pandemic
period (2020-2021), and the results are qualitatively the same (results not shown here to save space).
Second, we estimate the countries without the COVID-19 pandemic periods (2020-2021) using the SVAR for
each country (Figures 13, 14, and 15). Given the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it may
have affected inflation that may not be explained by weather anomalies and supply chain pressures. The
results suggest that weather shocks do not generally affect supply chain pressures. In contrast, we see that
supply chain pressures raise inflation in most countries, and the negative relationship between supply chain

pressures and inflation in Korea is due to the Asian financial crisis, as explained in the baseline results. When
it comes to weather shocks and inflation, we see that the estimation outcomes are also similar to the baseline
estimates. Accordingly, the COVID-19 pandemic did not considerably alter the baseline estimates.
Third, since inflation and supply chain pressures in respective countries are affected by the COVID-19
pandemic and shocks specific to each country, we attempt to account for it. For instance, the Asian financial
crisis considerably affected inflation and supply chain pressures in Asian countries. The European debt crisis
from 2009 to mid-2010s also impacted inflation and supply chain pressures in the Euro Area. The 2008-2009
global financial crisis affected all the countries considered in this study. We, therefore, re-estimate each country
with the SVAR and divide the time into two periods. First, we run from January 2000 to December 2007 to
circumvent the Asian and global financial crisis. Second, we run from January 2010 to December 2019 to avoid
the 2008 global financial crisis shock and the COVID-19 pandemic.

We see that the estimation outcomes in different periods show contrasting results (Figures 16-21). First, we
find that weather anomalies could raise supply chain pressures before 2008, particularly in the US, whereas
they have no impact on it after (excluding the COVID-19 pandemic period). This implies that supply chain
pressures in recent periods have been driven more significantly by factors, such as energy prices and delays in
delivery of parts and components. Second, the effects of supply chain pressures on inflation are statistically
more significant after 2008 in four countries (China, Korea, the UK, and the US) than before (China and Japan).
Our intuition is the growing demand for manufactured goods combined with the rising global value chain
participation of the countries considered. Third, weather anomalies could raise inflation before 2008,
particularly in the US, but it has no impact on inflation generally, or it reduces it after 2008.
Fourth, we decompose inflation into cyclical and trend components by applying the Hodrick-Prescott filter. Our
baseline results could pick up trend inflation, which has declined over time. Although the falling trend inflation
would be more significant in Japan, we use the cyclical component of inflation for all countries by eliminating
the trend component for robustness. Our results are broadly similar to the baseline results. One difference is
that weather shocks could increase the cyclical component of inflation in the US for about three months. Again,
the negative relationship between supply chain pressures and the cyclical component of inflation in Korea is
driven by the Asian financial crisis in 1998. We see a positive relationship when this period is removed, like in
Appendix Figure A1.

VII. Conclusion
The world economy has experienced a series of unprecedented shocks over the past three years, disrupting
supply chains, causing a deep recession, and pushing inflation to the highest level since the 1970s. While
inflation is on a downward trajectory with economic activity on the mend, vulnerabilities persist. One of the most
significant risks to the global economy and financial markets is climate change. As human-induced climate
change accelerates over the coming decades, greater frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions
can have far-reaching adverse consequences for physical infrastructure and economic activity. There is
convincing evidence that climate-related natural disasters have significant effects on inflation and economic
growth. An important channel of this relationship is the impact of weather anomalies—caused by climate
change—on global supply chains in the production and distribution of goods and services. Disruptions during
the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing sharp increase in global inflation have highlighted the importance of
risks to the complex and interdependent network of supply chains across the world. With rising global
temperatures, extreme weather events stress transportation infrastructure and highly-connected global supply
chains, interrupting production, causing shortages, and leading to higher prices.
Demand-side factors certainly play a significant role in driving inflation, but this paper aims to close an
important gap in the literature by investigating the impact of weather anomalies on global supply chains and
inflation dynamics. Using monthly data covering six large and well-diversified economies—China, the Euro
area, Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States—over the period 1997-2021, we implement a
SVAR model and trace the contemporaneous effects of weather anomalies on supply chains and inflation
dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in the literature to investigate the impact of
weather shocks on supply chain pressures and alternative measures of inflation using a SVAR model, which
offers insights on how climate change could affect global supply networks and inflation dynamics beyond the
sample of countries used in the analysis.
We find that weather anomalies could disrupt supply chains and subsequently lead to inflationary pressures.
Our results—based on high-frequency data and robust to alternative estimation methodologies—show
significant heterogeneity across countries in the sample, which we attribute to differences in the severity of
weather shocks and vulnerability to supply chain disruptions. The impact of weather shocks on supply chains
and inflation dynamics is likely to become more pronounced with accelerating climate change that can have
non-linear effects. Although our empirical results do not always show a strong positive link between weather
shocks and supply chain disruptions, due to, in part, the use of aggregated supply-side disruptions, this does
not imply that we can be complacent about increasing weather anomalies. For instance, a severe drought has
reduced water level considerably in Panama Canal, disrupting trade route connecting Asia and North America.
Our results have important policy implications. Central bankers should consider the persistent impact of
weather anomalies on supply chains and inflation dynamics to prevent entrenching second-round effects and
de-anchoring inflation expectations. More directly, however, governments can invest more for climate change
adaptation to strengthen critical infrastructure and thereby minimize supply chain disruptions.

Note: Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test is employed. C and T indicate constant and trend, respectively. P-values
are reported. ***, **, and * denote 1%, 5% and 10% significance levels, respectively. Lag 1 is used. We have used lag
2 and the results are broadly similar. We have employed the Phillips-Perron unit root test to test the robustness of the
non-significant CPI series, and headline and core CPI with constant and trend are stationary in China. Given the
inverse hyperbolic sine transformation of CPI series, which reduces outliers and volatility, we consider the CPI series
stationary in our study.

Appendix Figure A1. Supply Chain Pressures and Inflation: Korea

Note: The figure presents the cumulative response of core inflation to supply chain pressures in dark blue line and 68
percent confidence intervals in light blue. The Asian financial crisis (1997-1999) and the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021)
periods are eliminated.
