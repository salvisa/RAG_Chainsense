Abstract

This paper examines how firms adapt to climate-change risks resulting from their supplychain networks. Combining a large sample of global supplier-customer relationships
with granular data on local temperatures and flooding incidents, we first document
that the occurrence of climate shocks at affected supplier firms has both a large direct
and indirect negative effect on earnings and revenues of suppliers and their customers.
Second, we show that customers are 10% to 20% more likely to terminate existing
supplier-relationships when realized climate shocks at the supplier firms exceed ex-ante
expected climate shocks. Further, customers subsequently switch to suppliers with lower
heatwave and flooding exposure. Our results indicate that climate change affects the
formation of global production networks.

Introduction

Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time. The average global surface temperature
has increased by 0.85◦ Celsius (1.5◦ F) since the industrial revolution, leading to more frequent
extreme weather events such as heatwaves, forest fires, and catastrophic floods, with dramatic
effects for society and economic activity (Carleton and Hsiang, 2016). According to the 2017 U.S.
Climate Science Special Report, the cost of extreme climate-related events for the United States
alone has exceeded $1.1 trillion since 1980 (CSSR, 2017).1 By the end of the century, temperatures
are expected to increase even further by 0.9 to 5.4◦ C (1.6 – 9.7◦ F) (IPCC, 2013).
While the academic literature in finance and economics has provided broad evidence on the
adverse effects of climate change, including corporate earnings (Addoum, Ng, and Ortiz-Bobea,
2019), labor productivity (Graff-Zivin, Hsiang, and Neidell, 2018), stock returns (Kumar, Xin, and
Zhang, 2019), and capital structure (Ginglinger and Moreau, 2019), much less is known about how
firms and market participants can adapt to climate change. In contrast, managers and investors
are increasingly looking for ways to mitigate climate change risks, for example by adapting their
operations and investments (Lin, Schmid, and Weisbach, 2018).2
In the age of globalization, most firms operate in extensive global production and supply-chain
networks. Supply-chains often move through parts of the world that are most vulnerable to climate
impacts. As a result, adapting to climate change is a complex task, as firms might be indirectly
exposed to climate change risks due to their suppliers and customers.3 Indeed, Barrot and Sauvagnat
(2016) and Seetharam (2018), among others, show that the impact of extreme weather events can
propagate through firm-level production networks. Consequently, in a recent survey, over 50% of
CEOs mentioned risks posed to their global supply chains by climate change as one of their primary
concerns (PWC, 2015).
Hence, the aim of this paper is twofold. First, we investigate if firms are affected by climate
change risk due to their global supply-chain network. Specifically, we estimate the firm performance
effects of climate change related extreme weather events on supplier firms around the world and the

propagation of climate-related performance shocks to their corporate customers. Second, we study
how firms adapt their supply-chain organizations in response to climate change risks. In particular,
we examine if customers optimize and diversify their supplier network by replacing high-risk with
low-risk supplier firms.
We combine detailed global, firm-level supply-chain data from FactSet Revere with geographic
location data from FactSet Fundamentals and granular climate data on heatwaves from the European
Center for Medium-term Weather Forecasts and floods from the Darthmouth Flood Observatory.
Our supply-chain dataset includes 4,289 (4,568) unique supplier (customer) firms, comprising over
200,000 quarterly supplier-customer observations across 51 countries around the world, over the
period from 2003 to 2017.4 We focus on two types of climate change risks – extreme heatwaves and
flooding – for the following reasons. First, the literature in physiology and economics has pointed
to several direct and indirect channels through which heatwaves can affect firm productivity. For
example, extreme heat reduces human capital (Graff-Zivin et al., 2018), labor provision (Graff-Zivin
and Neidell, 2014), and productivity (Zhang, Deschenes, Meng, and Zhang, 2018), with sharp
declines typically observed at temperatures over 30◦ C.5 Given current global carbon emissions, the
number of heat days (i.e. days that exceed 100◦ F) is projected to rise dramatically, from currently
1% of days to more than 15% of days by 2099 (Graff-Zivin and Neidell, 2014), making extreme
heatwaves a common and impactful phenomenon in the future. Second, flooding incidents can cause
enormous economic damage to the affected region. According to FEMA, the United States suffered
more than $260 billion in flood-related damages between 1980 and 2013. As a result of climate
change, both inland and coastal floods are expected to become more frequent and severe in the
coming years (CSSR, 2017).
While Addoum et al. (2019) and Pankratz, Bauer, and Derwall (2019) show that exposure to
local heatwaves affects the profitability of listed firms in many industries, both the question if climate
change related shocks propagate along firm-level links and how customer firms can potentially
mitigate such risks are unclear. First, the implications of climate shocks for suppliers and customers
might differ. While extreme temperatures and floods might be costly to supplier firms, for example
4
In contrast to previous research on supply-chains in finance, which has mostly relied on data from Compustat
Segment Files, this dataset allows us to study the initiation and termination of customer-supplier relationships. See
Section 2 for details.

High temperatures are also associated with higher civil conflict risk (Burke, Hsiang, and Miguel, 2015a) and
immigration (Feng, Krüger, and Oppenheimer, 2010), which might indirectly impact firms in the affected areas.

by increasing energy consumption for air conditioning or clean-up costs, customer firms would be
unaffected by such shocks if suppliers cannot pass on the incurred costs downstream. In this case,
neither heat nor flood related shocks would propagate from suppliers to customers. On the other
hand, if heatwaves or floods lead to lower production output, such disruptions could propagate
along the supply-chain and affect customer firms, potentially with a delay.
Second, if managers understand the risks of climate change, they plausibly organize operations
to absorb climate risks and minimize disruptions due to shocks to their suppliers. Again, we would
not expect climate shocks to propagate from suppliers to customer in this case. On the other hand,
frictions such as relationship-specific investments or a high degree of input specialization might
prevent customer firms from making such adjustments or from switching to alternative suppliers.
Further, the risks of climate change have become much more salient over the past decades, as the
frequency of extreme weather events and scientific evidence of future risks and public awareness
both have increased. If managers are increasingly considering climate change risks when making
operational and investment decisions, we would expect that customers become more likely to switch
suppliers when observed climate change risks exceed previous expectations.
Our first set of tests focuses on the effect of climate change related weather events on the
operating performance of affected supplier firms. Following the climate science literature (Carleton
and Hsiang, 2016), we construct a location specific measure of heatwaves for our sample supplier
firms based on the daily temperatures over a given quarter in the location of the firm’s production
facilities. Consistent with Addoum et al. (2019), we document that the occurrence of a heatwave
during one of the three previous firm-quarters is associated with a subsequent reduction in revenue
(operating income) by 3.9% (9.7%) relative to the sample median. Focusing on flooding incidents,
we document a decrease by 3.9% (10.2%) relative to the sample median. These results hold after
controlling for firm-fixed effects, firm-specific seasonal trends, industry-specific time trends, as well
as a host of firm- and industry characteristics and trends.
Next, we provide evidence that firms are indeed exposed to climate change risks due to their
global supply-chain network. Our findings show that climate change related shocks to supplier
firms have a negative effect on the performance of their customers. Following the occurrence of a
heatwave in a given firm-quarter at a single supplier, customer revenues decrease by 0.2% relative
to the sample median. When suppliers are affected by a local flooding incident, customer revenue
3

and operating income are reduced by 1.8% and 2.2%, respectively. Consistent with Barrot and
Sauvagnat (2016), these effects hold with a lag of up to four quarters.
We conduct a number of robustness tests. First, we employ counting measures of heatwaves and
flood incidents instead of using dummy variables and find similar result. Second, we implement our
experiments both at the supplier-customer-quarter observation level as well as in a collapsed sample
of customer-quarter-level observations, aggregating across suppliers for each sample customer. The
results are similar in both settings. Third, we implement a placebo test by studying time periods in
which our supplier-customer pairs were not yet or no longer in a supply-chain relationship. We find
no evidence of climate risk propagation during these placebo periods.
Our main tests focus on the adaptation of supply-chains to climate change risks. We first
examine how climate change risk affects the likelihood that customers terminate the relationship
with their customers. Assuming that managers trade off potential climate-related risks with other
firm characteristics (product quality, costs, delivery times, etc.) when entering a supply-chain
relationship, we hypothesize that a customer firm is more likely to terminate an existing supplierrelation when the climate shocks observed over the course of a supply-chain relationship exceed the
ex-ante anticipated risks. We therefore construct a measure of realized vs. expected climate risk
by comparing heatwaves and flood incidents after the establishment of a supply-chain link to the
observed climate shocks in the years before as a benchmark.
We document a large, positive effect of realized vs. expected climate risk on supplier termination.
Our results show that a supply-chain relationship is 1.0 (3.7) percentage points more likely to
be terminated in a given year, if the realized number of heatwaves (floods) exceeds the ex-ante
expected number. This effect is economically meaningful given the unconditional expectation
that a supply-chain relationship ends in any given year of 15.1% in our sample. The results are
robust to using several alternative ways of constructing our climate risk measure, and significant
at the 1%-level, controlling for any time-invariant supplier-by-customer characteristics, various
time-variant financial supplier and customer characteristics, industry-by-time fixed effects, and
country-by-time fixed effects. Importantly, when we solely consider the occurrence of heatwaves and
floods throughout the supply-chain relationship (without comparing it to ex-ante expected climate
shocks), we find a much smaller, statistically insignificant impact on the likelihood of supply-chain
relationship termination. This is consistent with the notion that managers are taking climate risks
4

into consideration when entering a supply-chain relationship.
Last, we examine how firms optimize their supply-chain climate risk by analyzing if customers
switch from high climate-risk to low climate-risk suppliers. For this purpose, we consider all instances
of ending supply-chain relationships in our sample and match each ‘dropped’ supplier with the
‘replacement’ suppliers, i.e. firms with the same 4-digit SIC code which newly became suppliers to
the same customer within the next two years. We then compare the realized climate risk of the
dropped and replacement suppliers based on the number of heatwaves and flooding incidents over
the same time period. We find that replacement suppliers on average have 0.83 fewer heatwaves
and 0.03 fewer floods than terminated suppliers, measured over the duration of the relation with
the terminated supplier. The result is statically significant at the 1% level (t-statistics of 17.9 and
4.2), and robust to alternative comparison periods and climate risk measures.
Our paper contributes to the literature on the economic effects of climate change along several
dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first evidence of operational adaptation
to climate change-risk at the firm level. Our main result shows that managers respond to climate
risks resulting from their supply-chain network by switching from high-risk to low-risk suppliers,
indicating that climate risks can drive the formation of global firm-level production networks. This
finding has important potential implications. As the climate science literature has shown (e.g.
Burke, Hsiang, and Miguel, 2015b and Carleton and Hsiang, 2016), developing countries around the
world are more severely affected by the outcomes of global climate change than developed countries
in North America and Western Europe. However, as particularly the largest corporations traded on
international stock exchanges rely on extensive, worldwide production networks, it is important for
managers and policymakers to be aware of the extent to which the economic implications of climate
change are shared through supply chain links. Moreover, if firms further shift economic activity
from ‘southern’ to ‘northern’ countries due to heterogeneity in climate change risk, this effect could
contribute to widening global inequality and economically weaken the areas most vulnerable to
climate change. Lin et al. (2018) also study climate change adaptation, focusing on the investments
of electricity generating firms in more flexible power generation technologies.
This paper also provides novel evidence on the implications of climate change for firms and
investors. Previous research in the finance literature has studied the direct effects of climate shocks
on firm profitability (Zhang et al., 2018; Addoum et al., 2019; Pankratz et al., 2019), housing prices
5

(Baldauf, Garlappi, and Yannelis, 2019), stock returns (Kumar et al., 2019), financial markets
(Bansal, Kiku, and Ochoa, 2016; Hong, Li, and Xu, 2019; Schlenker and Taylor, 2019), and capital
structure (Ginglinger and Moreau, 2019). Our paper is the first to show that firms can be indirectly
exposed to climate shocks due to their global supplier network. This aspect of our findings is
most closely related to Barrot and Sauvagnat (2016), Seetharam (2018), and Boehm, Flaaen, and
Pandalai-Nayar (2019), who document the propagation of natural disasters along input-output
linkages. The fundamental difference between our study and these papers is that we focus on the
effects of temperature exposure and flood incidents, allowing us to assess the potential impact of
climate change risk propagation along supply-chain links.

Data Sources and Descriptive Statistics

To conduct our empirical analysis, we combine data on global supply-chain relationships, firm
financial performance, and granular data on local climate exposure from four main sources. In the
following sections we describe the data sources in detail, explain how we link the individual datasets,
and provide summary statistics for our main sample. The final sample used for the empirical
tests in Sections 3 and 5 varies, as we merge supplier-customer relationship data with different
climate change-related databases. For example, in Section 3 we focus on the propagation of climate
shocks along existing supply-chain links, while Section 5 explores the determinants of customers
switching suppliers. The following summary statistics therefore refer to our main sample used to
examine climate shock propagation in Section 3. For this purpose, we retain each supplier- and
customer-quarter in our main sample for which a complete record of supply-chain data, financial
information, and climate exposure data is available. Throughout the rest of the paper, we provide
relevant summary statistics and details in the context of the respective empirical tests.

2.1

Global Supply-Chains

We start by obtaining information on customer-supplier relationships from the recently available
FactSet Revere database. Previous research on supply-chains in finance (e.g. Hertzel, Li, Officer,
and Rodgers, 2008; Cohen and Frazzini, 2008; Banerjee, Dasgupta, and Kim, 2008) has relied
primarily on the SEC’s regulation S-K, which requires U.S. firms to disclose the existence and
6

names of customer firms representing at least 10% of their total sales, to identify customer-supplier
links. In contrast, the Revere supply-chain data has two important advantages that are particularly
important in the context of this paper. First, while the SEC regulation does not apply in other
countries, hence limiting existing research mostly to U.S. firms, Factset Revere supply-chain data
includes both U.S. and foreign supplier and customer firms. This is important because many of the
regions most vulnerable to climate change around the world are located outside of the United States.
Second, and more importantly, previous research relying on the SEC regulation has been unable
to study the initiation and termination of supplier-customer relationships, since the appearance
and disappearance of a given supply-chain link in the data might either be due to a customer
starting/ending a relationship with a given supplier, or because a customer firm was above/below the
10% reporting threshold in a given year. In contrast, the Revere supply-chain data is hand-collected,
verified, and updated by FactSet analysts relying on a range of primary sources of information,
including companies’ annual reports and 10-K filings, investor presentations, company websites
and press releases, corporate actions, and 10-Q and 8-K filings. This is crucial for our analysis of
supply-chain formation and climate change adaptation, as it provides us with precise information
on the beginning and end of a given supplier-customer relationship.
In total, our sample includes 4,568 unique customer firms and 4,289 unique supplier firms
across 51 different countries, comprising approximately 220,000 supplier-customer pair-year-quarter
observations over the sample period from 2003 to 2017. The geographical and industry distribution
of the suppliers and customers in our sample is summarized in Table 1 and visually illustrated in
Figures 1 and 2. As documented in Table 1, most of the suppliers and customers in our sample
operate in manufacturing (SIC 1st digits 2 and 3) or transport and utilities (SIC 1st digit 4).
Geographically, the majority of suppliers are located in North America (41%), East Asia and Pacific
(30.6%) and Europe or Central Asia (18.4%). The regional distribution of customers is similar to
the geographic distribution of the suppliers.
Table 2a (Panel C) presents relationship-level summary statistics for the firms in our sample.
As documented, the average supply-chain relationship in the sample lasts 13.83 quarters. Similar
to previous research on supply-chains in finance (e.g. Cen, Dasgupta, Elkamhi, and Pungaliya,
2015; Cen, Maydew, Zhang, and Zuo, 2017; Cen, Chen, Hou, and Richardson, 2018), we document
an asymmetric mutual importance between customers and their suppliers in our sample. First,
7

sample customer firms are typically much larger than their suppliers. The median sample customer
holds 29 times the assets of the median supplier firm (book value of assets). Second, for firm-pairs
where detailed sales data from supplier to customer is available (9.39% of the sample), the average
proportion of sales the sample customers represent to their suppliers is 17.87%, while the average
proportion of cost-of-goods-sold (COGS) suppliers represent to customers is only 1.82%. This
relationship asymmetry suggests that customers on average have higher bargaining power in the
relationship with their suppliers.

2.2

Accounting Performance and Firm Characteristics

Next, we obtain quarterly financial performance records for the firms in our sample from 2000
to 2017 from Compustat Global.6 Our main variables of interest for measuring operating firm
performance in Section 3 are quarterly revenues and operating income, scaled by asset size. In
addition to financial performance data, we obtain information on firms’ financial reporting schedules
to ensure that we correctly match climate records and performance records when financial quarters
deviate from calendar quarters. To ensure that international financial records comparable, we
convert all variables into U.S. dollars using the WRDS currency conversion tables, and deflate the
values using the consumer price index information provided by the International Financial Statistics
of the International Monetary Fund.
We further collect data on several additional firm characteristics from FactSet as control variables.
These characteristics include firm controls such as the date of the first trade of the firms’ shares to
construct a proxy for firm age, the price-to-book ratio as well as the debt-to-assets ratio. To remove
outliers, we trim all variables above (below) the 99th (1st) percentile. We further drop firms with
incomplete records of financial information and exclude firms in the financial industry (SIC code
between 6000 and 6999).
Panels A and B of Table 2a report summary statistics for customer and supplier financial
performance and firm characteristics after applying the data filters outlined above. In line with
the expectation that suppliers are on average smaller than their customers, the average book
value of assets is is 6,354 million USD for customer firms, and 5,097 million USD for suppliers.
6

Compared to our sample of supply-chain relationships from FactSet Revere, we extend the financial performance
sample by three years for later placebo tests, see Table 5.

8

Customers (Panel A) and suppliers (Panel B) have similar operating performance in our sample.
The average quarterly (median) customer Revenue/Assets is 23.99% (19.91%) for customers and
21.96% (18.77%) for suppliers. The average quarterly (median) customer Operating Income/Assets
is 2.47% (2.57%) for customers and 1.92% (2.31%) for suppliers.

2.3

Firm Locations

A crucial requirement for our empirical analysis of the impact of climate shocks on downstream
propagation and the formation of supply-chain relationships is identifying the location of our sample
firms. In this paper, we obtain information on the location of firms’ operations from the FactSet
Fundamentals database. Specifically, as our primary measure for firm location we use the addresses
(City, Zip Code, Street Name) of firm headquarters as obtained from FactSet Fundamentals.
Of course, firms’ plants and establishments are not always located in the same location as firms’
headquarters. However, this measurement error is likely to bias our estimates in Sections 3 and
5 against finding any effect of climate shocks on firm performance and supply-chain formation.
In addition, we use FactSet Revere information on firms’ geographical concentration of assets to
determine in which locations firms operate. These records are collected based on firms’ public
reporting of assets, sales, and income by geographic and product segments. Specifically, publicly
listed firms are required to disclose these concentrations for all segments which represent more than
10% of total assets, sales, or income. In our main analysis, we limit our sample to firms with more
than 50% of their assets in their home country to ensure that climate shocks affect a substantial
part of firms’ assets and operations. To match firms with the local information on climate hazards,
we geocode the addresses of their headquarters using the Bing Maps API.
We apply two additional location-based data filters to our main sample: First, we remove
decentralized firms with < 50% of assets in their primary geographic segment. Second, we drop all
supplier-customer firm-pairs for which the headquarters of the two firms are located within 500km of
each other in the analyses of Section 5, to rule out that both firms are affected simultaneously by the
same climate shocks. As reported in Panel A and B of Table 2a, both customers and suppliers hold
a substantially larger share of their assets in their home country than imposed by our 50% threshold:
the average asset home-country concentration of customers is 79.4%, and the concentration of
suppliers’ assets is 80.5%.

2.4

Climate Data

In this paper we focus on two types of climate change related shocks – extreme heatwaves and
flooding incidents – for the following reasons. First, heatwaves and floods are regionally concentrated
events, allowing us to exploit the high granularity of climate data and the resulting geographic
variation in climate exposure across our sample firms in our empirical tests. Second, climate science
research widely agrees that heatwaves and floods are expected to become significantly more frequent
and severe in the coming years (CSSR, 2017), making these climate shocks a particularly important
subject of study for assessing the future economic costs of climate change. This is different from other
type of natural disasters previously studied in the literature, e.g. earthquakes, as their occurrence
cannot be unambiguously linked to climate change. Third, while both extreme heat and floods can
cause significant economic damage (see e.g. Graff-Zivin et al., 2018; Graff-Zivin and Neidell, 2014;
Zhang et al., 2018), the two types of climate shocks possibly affect firms’ operating performance
and the results propagation effects through different channels. This allows us to further study the
way climate shocks affect supply-chain formation by comparing similarities and differences between
the effects of heatwaves and flooding incidents.
2.4.1

Heatwaves

First, we construct indicators capturing the occurrence of heatwaves at the firm-quarter-level from
daily, location-specific information on maximum temperatures. The global coverage of weather
station-based temperature records varies substantially across time and across different regions
around the world. The resulting data gaps can cause substantial issues for empirical analysis, as
weather station coverage can for example be correlated with other economic characteristics of a
given region. To alleviate this concern, we use ‘re-analysis’ temperature data7 from the European
Center for Medium-term Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), which is available at a significantly higher
geographical and temporal granularity than the temperature data used in previous research (see
e.g. Lin et al., 2018). Specifically, we use the ERA-Interim reanalysis data set with global, daily
coverage of a 0.75 × 0.75° latitude-longitude grid. The data is available starting in 1979.8
7
Re-analysis temperatures are generated by interpolating local temperatures based on data from existing weather
stations and a number of other atmospheric data sources based on scientifically established climate models.

10

To construct our sample of local heatwave shocks, we begin by matching daily maximum temperatures to customer and supplier firms by based on the closest ERA-interim latitude-longitude grid
nodes for the geocoded addresses of our sample firms. Next, we convert the temperatures from Kelvin
to °Celsius and identify the start and end dates of heatwaves. Following the heatwave definition of the
National Weather Service, we label spells of three or more days with daily maximum temperatures
over 30° Celsius by firm location as the occurrence of a heatwave (National Weather Service, 2019)9 .
Additionally, we compute the duration of the heatwaves by location and heatwave, and aggregate
the number of heatwave days on the monthly, and later on the firm-quarter level.
Table 2b reports summary statistics on climate shocks affecting the customers and suppliers in
our sample. As Panel A (customers) and B (supplier) of Table 2b show, the firms in our sample are
regularly exposed to heatwaves, 29.8% of customer-firm-quarters and 36% of supplier-firm-quarters
are affected by at least one heatwave in our sample. The average length of the heatwaves (consecutive
days over 30° C) is substantial with an average of 23.8 heatwave days per financial quarter for
suppliers, conditional on the occurrence of a heatwave, and 24.2 days for customers. On average,
suppliers and customers are exposed to similar temperatures, with a sample average temperature of
18.6° Celsius (18.5° Celsius) for the customers (suppliers).
2.4.2

Floods

Second, we obtain data on global surface water levels to determine whether firms are affected by
flooding incidents in a given quarter. While surface temperatures are the most commonly cited
consequence of global climate change, the scientific literature widely agrees that flooding incidents
will also increase significantly in frequency and severity in the future as a direct result of climate
change, i.e. due to heavy rainfall, rapid melting of snow and ice, and parched soil (CSSR, 2017). At
the same time, flooding can cause significant economic damage, providing us with a second type of
climate shock that potentially affects firms in a different way than heatwaves.
We gather information on surface water levels from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory. To
compile this data, the Dartmouth Observatory models the earth surface as a set of highly granular
Koehler, Matricardi, McNally, Monge-Sanz, Morcrette, Park, Peubey, de Rosnay, Tavolato, Thpaut, and Vitart 2011
provide a detailed description of the data set.

Precisely, the National Weather Services defines heatwaves as “three or more consecutive days with the temperature
reaching or exceeding 90 degrees (Fahrenheit)”.

11

polygons and uses on satellite images and remote sensing sources to identify flooding of inundated
ares. In addition, the observatory collects information on floods from news and governmental sources.
The dataset includes start and end dates for each flood and detailed geographical information
on the inundated areas polygons, from 1984 until today. The dataset further provides additional
information on the floods such as the associated damages, size of the affected area, and deaths. We
rely on the flood polygons used by the Dartmouth Observatory to spatially match the coordinates
of our sample firms to the areas affected by the floods using the software QGIS. Compared to the
country-level flooding data used in previous research, this approach allows us to determine more
precisely if a given firm location was inundated at a given point in time.
Equivalent to the procedure outlined in Section 2.4.1 for the heatwave records, we compute the
number of days for which a firm was exposed to a given flood, and aggregate the count of floods on
a monthly basis. Panel A and B of Table 2b illustrate the aggregate flooding summary statistics at
the firm-quarter level. On average, suppliers and customers experience floods in 6.0% and 6.1% of
all firm-quarters. The average number of 26.7 (30.8) casualties conditional on the occurrence of a
flood suggests that we observe flood events with a substantial magnitude.
2.4.3

EM-DAT Disaster Data

For additional robustness tests in Section 3 we also include climate shock data from the international
disaster database EM-DAT provided by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters
(CRED, 2011). EM-DAT is one of the most commonly used datasets in the literature on the
economic cost of climate hazards.10 To compare our heatwave and flood data with the country-level
EM-DAT disaster, we first distinguish if the temperature-related EM-DAT events are heatwaves or
cold spells. Subsequently, we aggregate flood and heat events on a monthly basis based on the start
and end dates, and combine the disaster data with our local records from the ECMWF and the
Darthmouth Flood Observatory. Table 2b provides the EM-DAT summary statistics.
We conjecture that our high-granularity heatwave and flood incidents data and the country-level
data from EM-DAT differ along two dimensions. First, using country-level information naturally
overstates the extent to which firms have been affected by natural disasters. In that case, the
EM-DAT shocks would overstate firms’ exposure to both floods and heatwaves. Second, the salience
10

See for example: Strömberg, 2007; Noy, 2009; Lesk, Rowhani, and Ramankutty, 2016

12

of the two hazard types and the probability that events are registered should differ across data
sources. Both heat and flood events are recorded by EM-DAT only if they either caused ten or more
associated casualties, affected more than 100 people, lead to the declaration of a state of emergency,
or resulted in a call for international assistance. While floods are highly visible, the relevance of
extreme temperatures and heatwaves can be contingent on the context, and hence more difficult
to identify. Therefore, we expect that the disaster data only captures a subset of both floods and
heatwaves that we can detect locally, particularly in the case of heatwaves.
In line with this reasoning, the average number of flood-affected firm-quarter observations is
significantly higher based on the country-level match compared to the EM-DAT match. For instance,
suppliers are physically exposed to floods only 6.1% of the time according to the local data, compared
to 49% if we match based on EM-DAT country-level records. The opposite holds for heatwaves.
While our local data suggests that heatwaves occur frequently, the disaster statistics yield a much
lower affected numbers of firm-quarters - despite the geographic overestimation.

Direct Exposure to Climate Shocks

We begin our analysis by studying the direct effects of climate shocks on the supplier firms in
our sample. This exercise is important to verify that the shocks we study in this paper indeed
have an economically significant effect on firm operating performance. Many of the regions most
severely affected by climate change are located outside of the developed countries of North America
and Western Europe. Hence, our analysis complements the results in Somanathan, Somanathan,
Sudarshan, and Tewari (2015); Zhang et al. (2018); Addoum et al. (2019), as we study the effect of
heatwaves on firm earnings and performance in a global setting. Further, by also studying flooding
incidents – in addition to local heatwaves – we are able to compare the economic effects of different
climate change related risks. In our main analysis we focus on heatwave and flooding data from
ECMWF and the Dartmouth Observatory, as the EM-DAT disaster data is less granular for floods
and too restrictive for heatwaves, as documented in Section 2.4.3.
One important consideration for our tests is that firms likely adjust to the average climate hazard
exposure in production locations. If managers understand climate risks and organize production
to maximize profits, they might choose (not) to produce in certain places if adjustment potential
13

is (in)sufficient, or they adjust the production equipment to match the expected climate exposure
– contingent on the firm’s financial capacity to do so. Hence, it the cross-sectional relationship
between climate exposure variables and firm financial performance is likely endogenous.
However, while managers can base their decisions on expected climate exposure, they do not
have power over the weather variation over time and the exact timing of climate shocks. Moreover,
both floods and heatwaves can only be predicted with precision on short horizons, which are unlikely
to allow for substantial adjustment in the production planning. Therefore, the variation in climate
shocks over time is an exogenous source of variation and randomly distributed once we condition on
fixed firm locations. This allows us to identify the causal impact of floods and heatwaves on firm
operating performance.
We isolate the effect of time-series variation in climate shocks for a given firm on firm operating
performance by estimating OLS regressions with firm-by-quarter fixed effects. By interacting
firm-fixed effects and quarter fixed effects, our model absorbs both any time-invariant firm-level
characteristics, as well as firm-specific seasonal effects during the four quarters of the year. This
is important because firm operating performance varies seasonally throughout the year, and this
seasonal variation might be correlated with the occurrence of climate shocks. Further, we include
industry-by-year-by-quarter fixed effects to absorb any industry-specific time trends.
Our two main variables for measuring firm operating performance in the following regression
models are sales turnover and profitability. Specifically, we use quarterly revenues and operating
income, divided by assets. We specifically focus on these two measures – as opposed to for example
earnings – since revenues and operating income are harder to manipulate by firms’ strategic
accounting - and the incentive to smooth earnings might be particularly high following adverse
financial shocks.
In principle, the location-specific variation in flood and heat shocks over time cannot be actively
influenced by firm choices. However, as climate shocks could randomly coincide with changes in
firm characteristics over time, we additionally introduce size, age, and profitability specific time
fixed effects. For this purpose, we sort all firms into size, age, and profitability terciles and interact
the grouping variables with year-quarter fixed effects in our main specification, following Barrot and
Sauvagnat (2016). Specifically, we estimate models of the following form, clustering robust standard

14

errors on the firm level in line with Barrot and Sauvagnat (2016):
yiqt =

0
X

βt × Climate Shocksiqt + µiq + γnqt + δBS2016 + iqt

(1)

t=−k

where yiqt is either Revenue/Assets (Rev/AT) or Operating Income/Assets (OpI/AT) of firm
i in quarter q of year t, Climate Shocksiqt is a dummy variable indicating the occurrence of a
heatwave or flood in the location of firm i in year-quarter qt, µiq are firm-by-quarter fixed effects,
γnqt are industry-by-year-by-quarter fixed effects based on 2-digit SIC codes, and δBS2016 are firm
size, age, and profitability × time fixed effects as in Barrot and Sauvagnat (2016). In robustness
tests, we also use the count of climate events by financial quarter as an alternative specification. As
it is ex-ante unclear if the financial impact of climate shocks manifests immediately or with some
delay throughout the financial year, we estimate two different specification of the outline model.
First, we limit the climate shock observations to the current financial quarter and second, i.e. we
restrict k = 0, second we additionally include three lags of three periods, i.e. k = 3.
[Insert Table 3 here.]
Table 3 reports the regression results for Equation (1). In Panel A we estimate regressions without
climate shock lags, in Panel B we additionally include three lags of climate shock events. The results
in both panels indicate that heatwaves and floods adversely impact the bottom line of our supplier
firms. However, the results also show that the full financial impact only becomes visible over the
course of the financial year. On the one hand, we find a very small contemporaneous impact of
heat events on firm operating performance, as both the effect on sales turnover and profitability is
statistically indistinguishable from zero in Panel A. At the same time, the occurrence of a flood is
associated with an average decrease in Revenue/Assets of 0.19 percentage points, and a decrease
in operating income over assets between 0.095 to 0.1 percentage points.
On the other hand, Panel B indicates that the financial impact of heatwaves and floods is
in fact much larger than the simple analysis of contemporaneous climate shocks suggests, in line
with the findings of Barrot and Sauvagnat (2016). When we include three lags of climate shocks
in Equation (1) while holding the sample fixed, we find a material impact of heatwaves on both
Rev/AT and OpI/AT between one to three financial firm quarters after the occurrence of a heatwave.
15

The coefficient estimate for the effect of heatwaves on sales turnover in columns (1) and (2) is
between -0.25 to -0.26 (statistically significant at the 5 and 10% level), and between -0.09 to -0.12
for operating margin in columns (3) and (4) for the coefficients with a lag of two to three quarters.
Floods similarly decrease sales turnover (between -0.25 and -0.29 percentage points, statistically
significant on the 5% and 10% level) and profitability (-0.11 to -0.12 percentage points, significant
on the 1% level) in the contemporaneous and the previous two financial quarters. Given the average
operating margin (OpI/AT) of 2% and sales turnover (Rev/AT) of 22% in our supplier sample,
the mean effects are economically meaningful, representing approximately a 1% reduction in sales
turnover and a 5.5% reduction in operating income over assets, relative to the sample mean. The
documented difference in how quickly financial performance measures reflect the occurrence of
climate shocks could have important implications for market participants. If heatwaves are reflected
by accounting measures of firm performance with a delay, it becomes more difficult for investors
to understand the link between the such temperature events and firm performance. Hence, this
delay could help explain the underreaction of investors to firms’ exposure to extreme temperatures,
documented in the recent literature (Addoum et al., 2019; Pankratz et al., 2019).
Our results naturally raise questions regarding the economic mechanisms driving the observed
effects. In the context of heatwaves, a large literature in economics has focused on the channels
through which extreme temperatures can cause aggregate economic losses11 . With regard to floods,
these channels have been studied less explicitly, but the observed net effect could be caused by
damages to assets, equipment and infrastructure, as well as production distortions during the floods,
e.g. if worker safety is endangered and production thereby constrained throughout the duration of
the floods. As the focus of our analysis lies on the direct and indirect performance implications of
climate shocks and the adaptation of supply-chain managers, we remain agnostic about the precise
mechanics of the directly observable effects in this paper.
We conduct several robustness tests for the direct effects of climate shocks on firm operating
performance. First, we estimate the impact of the climate shocks on supplier performance after
replacing heatwave and flood dummies with counting variables indicating the number of climate
events per financial quarter. The results are reported in Appendix Table A1 and show that the
11

Previous research documents that electricity prices increase with heat exposure (Pechan and Eisenack, 2014),
while water supply tightens (Mishra and Singh, 2010) and both cognitive and physical worker performance are
compromised (Sepannen, Fisk, and Lei, 2006; Xiang, Bi, Pisaniello, and Hansen, 2014).

16

statistical significance and overall pattern remain similar for this alternative specification. Moreover,
the statistically strongest effects of heatwaves again appear to occur with a delay of two quarters
after the firm was exposed to the heatwaves. Similarly, and in line with our main test in Table 3,
contemporaneous floods have a significant immediate as well as a two-quarter delayed impact on
sales turnover and operating income. When we use the count of heatwaves and floods per quarter for
our estimations, the magnitude of the coefficient estimates is naturally smaller than the aggregate
effect for all events in a financial quarter estimated in Table 3.
As our final robustness test on the direct impact of climate shocks, we estimate the impact of
heatwave and flooding disasters on supplier performance using the country-level data from EM-DAT.
Overall, the results reported in Appendix Table A2 confirm our conjecture from Section 2.4.3: for
evaluating the financial impact of climate shocks on the firm level the use of climate data with
high geographical granularity is essential. While heatwaves identified as disasters in the EM-DAT
database are negatively correlated with supplier performance only in the specifications in columns
(1) and (2) and with a delay of one financial quarter, the coefficient estimates are statistically
indistinguishable from zero, or even positive in all other specifications.

4

Indirect Exposure to Climate Shocks

Based on our result from the previous Section 3, showing that heatwaves and floods significantly
decrease supplier operating performance, we next test if climate hazards propagate downstream
along supply-chain links. Since particularly the largest corporations traded on international stock
exchanges rely on extensive, worldwide production networks, it is important to better understand
if even firms which are not located in areas with a high climate risk exposure can indirectly be
harmed by increases in the intensity of climate hazards due to their (remote) suppliers.
Analogous to our previous tests, we use sales turnover and profitability, measured by revenue
over assets and operating income over assets, as our two main dependent variables for assessing
whether climate risk is indeed propagated along supply-chains are. Despite the adverse direct
effect on suppliers documented above, the implications of climate shocks for supplier and customer
performance might differ. On the one hand, customer firms could be unaffected by shocks to
supplying firms if suppliers cannot pass on the incurred costs downstream. At the same time,
17

customers could also include climate factors in their contingency management, enabling them switch
suppliers without incurring large costs if a specific supplier is hit by a heatwave or flooding. In
both cases, neither heat nor flood related shocks would propagate from suppliers to customer along
the supply-chain, and we should not be able to document a significant impact of climate shocks to
suppliers on customer financial performance.
On the other hand, environmental shocks such as heatwaves or floods can cause supply-chain
glitches and lower production output at the supplier and customer level. These disruptions are
particularly likely if the provided inputs have a high level of specificity (Barrot and Sauvagnat,
2016). If climate shocks to suppliers on average cause distortions, we would expect to find a negative
relation between customer financial performance and supplier exposure to climate risk.
To test these competing hypotheses, we require two identifying assumptions. As in the previous
analysis, it is problematic to study this question in the cross-section, as the exposure of customer
firms to climate shocks through suppliers might be endogenous. For instance, if certain industries
systematically depend on specific inputs from suppliers clustered in risky areas, climate shocks
and customer firm performance might be endogenously correlated. In contrast, it is reasonable to
assume that the variation in supplier exposure to climate shocks over time is unrelated to time
invariant firm characteristics such as industry associations.12 Therefore, analogous to our model in
Equation (1), all our results in this section are due to within-firm-pair variation over time.
Second, customer firms could experience similar performance effects as their suppliers when
they themselves are hit by climate shocks. Therefore, to ensure that our results are not due climate
shocks affecting customer firms directly, we exclude all customers-supplier pairs with customers
located within a 500 kilometer radius of the affected supplier from our analysis.
Based on these considerations, we estimate two different models. In our first set of tests we
estimate pooled OLS regressions of the following form,
ycsqt =

0
X

βt × Climate Shockscsqt + µcsq + γn(c)t + δBS2016 + csqt

(2)

t=−3

where ycsqt is either Revenue/Assets or Operating Income/Assets of customer c in quarter q of
12
In our later analyses, we find that firms tend to terminate relationships with suppliers that face increases in
climate shock exposure compared to historical, expected levels of climate risk. However, the tendency of customers to
cut off suppliers that are particularly exposed to climate risk should only bias our effects downward.

18

year t, Climate Shockscsqt is a dummy variable indicating the occurrence of a heatwave or flood
in the location of supplier s in year-quarter qt, µcsq are supplier-customer pair-by-quarter fixed
effects, γn(c)qt are customer industry-by-year-by-quarter fixed effects based on 2-digit SIC codes,
and δBS2016 are customer firm size, age, and profitability × year-quarter fixed effects similar to
Equation (1). The unit of observation in these test is at the customer-supplier-year-quarter level. By
including pair-by-quarter fixed effects (γn(c)qt ), our model subsumes all time-invariant relationship
characteristics (e.g. supplier and customer country characteristics, languages, geographical distance,
average input specificity, average relationship strength, and firm fixed effects) as well as relationshipspecific seasonal patterns. Our results are therefore obtained from time-series variation in a given
firm-pair for the same quarter of the year.
In our second set of tests, we collapse our panel observations at the customer level by aggregating
over all suppliers of a given customer, and estimate regressions of the following form,
ycqt =

0
X

βt × Climate Shockscqt + µcq + γn(c)t + δBS2016 + cqt

(3)

t=−3

where ycqt again captures customer firm operating performance, and µcq , γn(c)t , and δBS2016 are fixed
effects at the customer-by-quarter, industry-by-year-by-quarter, and size/age/ROA × year-quarter
level. Climate Shockscqt is obtained as the maximum of Climate Shockscsqt over all suppliers s of
customer c in period qt. The unit of observation in these tests as at the customer-year-quarter level.
Based on our findings in Section 3, we include lags of k = 3 periods for the climate shocks in both
Model (2) and (3). In line with our identifying assumptions that the variation over time in flood and
heat shocks on suppliers are exogenous and that the supplier shocks only affect customers through
the supply chain link, other characteristics of the customer firms should not be systematically
correlated with both the outcome and the flood and heatwave occurrence. Hence, we do not include
firm-level controls in our main specification, but again add size, age, and profitability times quarter
fixed effects to control for different firm profiles, analogous to Equation 2. In line with Barrot and
Sauvagnat (2016), we cluster robust standard errors on the relationship and on the customer firm
level in Equations (2) and (3), respectively.

19

4.1

Climate Shock Propagation – Results

Table 4 reports the results for our first test on customers’ sensitivity to supplier climate risk exposure,
as detailed in Equation (2). The unit of observation in Panel A is at the supplier-customer-yearquarter level. The first four columns show the impact of supplier heatwaves, columns (5) to (8)
report the effect of supplier floods. With regard to heatwaves, we find tentative evidence that
the climate shocks on suppliers propagate along the supply chain. Specifically, we find a negative
impact (coefficient -0.044) of heatwaves at the supplier locations on customer revenues in column (2),
statistically significant at the 10% level. All other coefficient estimates for the propagation effect of
heatwaves lagged by one to three quarters are marginally not statistically significant. However, all
coefficient estimates carry negative signs, and the difference in the magnitude between the impact
of heatwaves on revenues and operating income is in line with the estimations of the direct impact
of heat on supplier firms. Hence, while the observed effect is small in our sample, our finding is still
economically meaningful, given that the frequency of heatwaves is projected to increase substantially
in the future due to ongoing climate change.
In comparison, the shock propagation of floods is unambiguous and both statistically and
economically large. According to our estimates, customer revenue over assets decreases between 0.10
to 0.16 percentage points in three quarters after the supplier has initially been exposed to a flood.
Moreover, customers’ operating income is reduced by 0.02 up to 0.04 percentage points (all effects
significant on the 1% level). These magnitudes are economically meaningful even at low climate
shock frequencies: Compared to the sample median, the occurrence of a flood at the supplier firm
reduces customer revenue and operating income by 1.8% and 2.2%, respectively.
[Insert Table 4 here.]
In Panel B of Table 4, we show the results for the sample collapsed on the customer level, implementing the model in Equation (3). Again, we find evidence that the climate shocks on supplier
firms propagate along the supply chain with a tentative, statistically negative impact of heatwaves
at the supplier locations on operating income (column (3), coefficient estimate of -0.052, significant
at the 5% level). For floods, the results are similar in magnitude to our first set of tests using the
full panel. The impact of floods at one of a given customer’s supplier firms reduces revenues over
assets between -0.15 and -0.16 percentage points (statistically significant at the 10% and 5% level),
20

with a lag of two calendar quarters. Further, floods have a significant negative effect on operating
income (coefficient estimates between -0.053 and -0.045 percentage points, significant at the 5% and
10% level), with a lag of one quarter.
Taken together, our results provide evidence that climate change related shocks can propagate
downstream along the supply-chain. This finding indicates that climate change could affect even
firms in relatively ‘climate-safe’ parts of the world as supply-chains span the globe. On average,
the results also suggest that suppliers can pass some of the cost caused by climate shocks on to
customers, or that not all customers in our sample are fully hedged against idiosyncratic shocks to
their suppliers through their contingency management. while the evidence on the side of heatwaves
is tentative13 , the flood-related effects are pronounced both in a statistical and economic sense. Our
results are consistent with Barrot and Sauvagnat (2016), who document that the financial shocks
imposed by natural disasters propagate along the supply chain when inputs are specific.

4.2

Climate Shock Propagation – Robustness

We conduct a number of robustness with respect to our findings on the propagation of climate shocks.
First, to verify that the effects we observe are indeed attributable to climate shock transmission
through supply-chain linkages, we implement a placebo test based on the start and end dates of our
sample supply-chain relationships. Specifically, we re-estimate our regressions models specified in
Equations (2) and (3) using the same sample of supplier-customer relationships. However, in our
placebo tests we use only the periods before and after a given supplier-customer pair was engaged
in a supply-chain relationship.
[Insert Table 5 here.]
If the supply-chain data from FactSet Revere correctly identifies the beginning and end of our
sample supplier-customer relations, and our results in Section 4.1 are indeed due to the propagation
of climate shocks, we should not find a negative effect of supplier climate shocks on customer firm
operating performance in the placebo sample. Indeed, as reported in Table 5, we do not find a
13

Given the marginally insignificant results for the heatwave-based tests, it is important to bear in mind that
the empirical setting biases the results downwards. First, if a share of the customers in the sample has a strong
contingency management with several alternative suppliers, and second, if managers respond to operational distortions
caused by troubled suppliers, and replace suppliers that are particularly exposed, so that affected supply-chain links
systematically drop out of the sample.

21

negative relation between supplier climate shocks and customer firm performance, neither when
conducting the tests on the full customer-supplier pair level sample (Panel A), nor on the collapsed
sample at the customer level (Panel B).
As an additional robustness test, we estimate the shock propagation based on a count measure
of heatwaves and floods instead of an indicator variable. The results are reported in Appendix Table
A3. Again, we find weak evidence for a propagation of heatwave-related shocks on the supplier
to the customer operating income (column 2, coefficient estimate of -0.015, significant at the 5%
level) and strong evidence for the propagation of flood related shocks. Last, we repeat our tests
using the country-level climate shock data from EM-DAT, analogously to Section 3. The results are
reported in Appendix Table A4. In line with our results focusing on the direct effect of climate
shocks, we cannot document a consistent relation between customer performance and the climate
disaster measures from EM-DAT.

5

Supply-Chain Adaptation

Our results in the previous sections show that climate-related shocks matter for firm financial
performance, both directly and indirectly through supply chain links. Hence, managers have an
incentive to monitor the climate-change related risk imposed by their suppliers. In this section, we
empirically test if managers indeed take climate-risk considerations into account by adapting their
to supply-chain relationships.

5.1

Climate Trends and Supplier Termination

We first test if climate-change risk increases the likelihood that a supplier-customer relationship is
terminated. On the one hand, costly climate-related shocks could cause operational issues at a given
supplier, making the firm a less attractive supply chain partner going forward. On the other hand,
customer and supplier firms often make substantial relationship-specific investments to set up and
maintain a supply chain relationship. It is unclear if the adverse financial consequences of climate
risk exposure are sufficiently high to result in the termination of an existing customer-supplier
relationship.
We use the FactSet Revere information on the start and end dates of customer-supplier relation22

ships to test these hypotheses. To construct the main outcome variable, we generate a panel of firm
years in which the customer-supplier relationships are active, and set the dummy variable 1 (End)
to take the value of one in the last year a given supply-chain relationship is reported in FactSet
Revere. To avoid mechanical issues in the last year of our sample we drop observations from 2017.
To construct our main variable of interest capturing supplier climate risk exposure, we start with
the assumption that managers trade off potential climate-related risks with other firm characteristics
such as product quality, costs and delivery times when entering a supply-chain relationship. Under
this scenario, a customer firm is generally aware of climate risks associated with a given supplier
and continuously weighs the costs and benefits of remaining in the relationship. As long as the
costs of leaving a given relationship exceed the costs of staying, the customer will continue the
relationship with a supplier. If this assumption holds, realized climate shocks over the course of a
supply-chain relationship that fall within the normal, ex-ante anticipated range of events given a
supplier’s location and climate risk will not substantially influence the likelihood that the supplier is
dropped, all else equal. However, if realized climate risks increase beyond the anticipated levels, and
in ways that firms are not prepared for or hedged against, it would reduce the economic viability of
a supplier-customer relationship and increase the profitability that the relationship ends.
To test this conjecture, we construct the measure 1 (Realized > Expected Climate Shocks) (t),
as illustrated in Figure 3. We first estimate the expected number of climate shocks per year in
the supplier location over a benchmark period of five14 yearsbefore the establishment of any given
supplier-customer relationship. 1 (Realized > Expected Climate Shocks) (t) then takes the value
of one in year t, if the difference between the realized number of climate shocks per year since
the beginning of the supplier-customer relationship exceeds the corresponding expected number of
shocks, and zero otherwise.
In econometric terms, our following test again relies on two identifying assumptions. First, we
exploit the fact that climate trends, besides the timing of climate shocks, are to a large extent
random over time and cannot be predicted with precision. Hence, managers can incorporate expected
levels of climate risk exposure, but not deviations from the expectation into their decision making.
Second, to be able to assume that the estimated effect is not caused by the direct impact of changing
climate risk on the customer, we again exclude all customers-supplier pairs with customers located
14

In robustness tests, we use seven, ten, and fifteen years, respectively.

23

within a 500 kilometer radius of the affected supplier. Based on these assumptions, our measure
of realized vs. expected climate risk is orthogonal to other firm decisions, and our corresponding
estimate reflects the impact of the change in supplier climate shock exposure. We estimate the
following linear probability model,
1 (End)sct = β × 1 (Realized > Expected Climate Shocks)st + µcs + γn(s)t + ρc(s)t + int

(4)

where 1 (End)sct is an indicator taking the value of one in year t if it is the last year on record of
the relation between supplier s and customer c.
To control for potential confounding effects, we estimate the regressions with several dimensions of
fixed effects. First, we include relationship fixed-effects µcs in all specification to account for supplier
characteristics that impact the probability of a relationship to end, but do not vary over time. For
instance, suppliers could face a fixed probability of termination based on their industry association.
Further, we include supplier industry-by-year fixed effects γn(s)t to account for industry trends, for
example related to the extent to which customers switch from buying inputs to manufacturing
inputs. We also add supplier country-year fixed effects ρc(s)t to account for changing macroeconomic
risks that impact whether customer firms maintain supplier-relationships. In addition, we estimate
the model with supplier country-customer-year × customer country-year fixed effects, to account
for changes in international trade dynamics, such as changing barriers or import-related costs. We
cluster robust standard errors on the relationship level.
[Insert Table 6 here.]
Table 6 reports the results. Across all specifications, we find a robust, positive impact of high realized
vs. expected climate exposure on the likelihood of supply-chain relationship termination. In line
with the results on the financial impact of the climate hazards as well as the financial propagation
of the shocks in the supply chains, the results suggest that increases in flood exposure increase
the probability a supply-chain relationship ends on average by 3.7 percentage points (column 8,
coefficient significant at the 1%-level). The impact of heatwave exposure increases is equally strong
in terms of its statistical significance but economically smaller at percentage points (column 4,
coefficient statistically significant at the 1%-level). The difference in the magnitude between floods
and heatwaves is in line with the stronger direct and indirect impact of floods compared to heatwaves
24

documented in Sections 3 and 4. Both the estimate for heatwaves and floods are economically
meaningful, given the unconditional expectation of 15.12% that a supply chain relationship ends in
any given year in our sample.
To test the robustness of this result, we change the horizon over which we compute the expected
number of floods or heatwaves per year. Appendix Table A5 indicates that the results are robust
when we extend the period from 5 to 7, 10, or 15 years, as both the estimates for heatwaves and
floods remain very similar in magnitude and significance. Moreover, we test whether the results
remain stable when we include additional time-variant financial control variables for both the
supplier and customer firms. Thereby, we control for changes in the financial health of the firms
which could otherwise influence the probability of the continuation of the relationship. As Appendix
Table A6 shows, the results again remain very similar both in magnitude and significance when we
control for changes in the debt-to-assets ratio, the log price-to-book ratio, and firm size proxied by
the natural logarithm of the market value of equity.

5.2

Climate Shocks and Supplier Termination

To validate our assumption that managers take climate risks into account when establishing
supply-chain relations, we next replace our measure of realized vs. expected climate risk with
a simple measure of realized climate shocks since the beginning of the supplier relationship. If
the general level of climate risk exposure is taken into consideration before forming supply chain
relationships, climate shocks per se should not be a strong determinant of supplier termination.
We again estimate the model in Equation (4), replacing 1 (Realized > Expected Climate Shocks)
with Climate Shocks (t) of the supplier firm.
[Insert Table 7 here.]
The results, reported in table Table 7 show the sensitivity of supply-chain relationship continuation
to realized climate shocks. Depending on the dimension of fixed effects, we find a small, positive
impact of heatwave and flood occurrence on the probability that a supply-chain relationship ends
for some specifications. However, the economic magnitude of this effect is small: For heatwaves,
the probability of termination is increases by 0.16 to 0.17 percentage points (columns 3 and 4,
coefficients significant at the 5% level), for floods, there is some evidence of an increase by 0.29 to
25

0.33 percentage points (columns 5 and 6, coefficients significant at the 1%-level). This effect is an
order of magnitude smaller and insignificant compared to the tests based on realized vs. expected
climate risk.
Taken together, our results are consistent with the notion that managers are taking climate risks
into consideration when entering a supply-chain relation. Also, the results suggest that increases in
climate risk exposure can be an important determinant of the probability of the continuation of the
relationships. If this effect holds globally, it could have important implications for international
development. According to Burke et al., 2015b and Carleton and Hsiang, 2016, developing countries
around the world are most severely affected by the outcomes of global climate change. If financial
incentives from supply-chain disruptions motivate ’Northern’ firms to further shift economic activity
from ‘Southern’ to ‘Northern’ countries, the effect could contribute to widening global economic
inequality.

5.3

Climate Risk Exposure of Old and New Suppliers

To shed further light on the question how firms adapt their supply-chains to climate change, and to
examine if climate risks are indeed driving the formation of production networks, we next study if
customers switch from high risk to low risk suppliers based on climate exposure. As we showed in the
previous section, realized climate shocks in exceedance of previously anticipated levels can increase
the likelihood that a given supplier relationship ends. However, it is unclear if managers understand
the link between climate risk exposure and financial performance, and hence mitigate these risks by
switching to different suppliers with lower climate exposure. Instead, customer managers might
simply observe the adverse financial effects of (indirect) climate shocks without considering climate
risk as an underlying driver of financial performance effects. Under this scenario, we would not
expect to find a difference in climate risk exposure between ‘old’ suppliers whose supply-chain
relationships are terminated and ‘new’ replacement suppliers.
To test this conjecture, we limit our dataset to supplier-customer links with a known end date,
retaining approximately 60,000 observations.15 Of course, not all supplier-customer relationships
in our sample end because of climate risk considerations. However, the noise introduced by this
15

Note that in contrast to the performance-related tests, in this setting we do not condition on the availability of
performance information for customer and supplier firms

26

measurement error would bias us against finding significant results. For each supplier whose
relationship with a customer ends throughout our sample period (i.e. ‘old’ supplier), we then
identify (likely) replacement suppliers who entered a new supply-chain relationship with the same
customer within the next two years, as reported in FactSet Revere. We require replacement
candidates to have the same four-digit SIC code as the ‘old’ supplier, and consider only supplychain relationships recorded by FactSet analysts for the first time in the two years after the ‘old’
supply-chain relationship ended. After applying these constraints, we identify 100,000 combinations
of terminated and replacement suppliers.
Next, we compare the climate hazard exposure of actual supplier firms during the active years
of the initial (‘old’) supply-chain relationship and their respective, likely, replacements. Figure 4
illustrates the construction of the test. First, we compare the number of climate shocks of the
actual, replaced supplier to the exposure that a replacement supplier would have had during the
time period in which the original relationship was active. Second, we estimate and compare the
number of climate shocks that actual and replacement suppliers were exposed to throughout the
whole sample period from 1984 to 2017. Third, we compare the time period after which the original
supply-chain relationship has ended. In all tests, we keep the observed years between the actual,
original, and hypothetical replacement suppliers constant. This requirement is important to ensure
that year-specific climate trends do not confound the comparison.
[Insert Table 8 here.]
Table 8 reports the mean differences and t-statistics of the comparison of the exposure of all
replaced suppliers and replacement suppliers. We conduct three tests per climate hazard: first,
based on the realized shocks throughout the entire sample period, second, based on the duration
of the supply-chain relationship, and third, based on the time thereafter until 2017. Focusing
on heatwaves, we find that replacement suppliers are on average less exposed during the original,
terminated relationship period, experiencing 0.83 fewer heatwaves on average. In the period after
the termination and during the time in which the new relationships are active, this difference further
increases to 2.0 fewer heatwaves (all differences are significantly different from zero at the 1% level).
The same pattern holds with regards to floods. Whereas potential replacement suppliers are slightly
less exposed to floods during the original relationship period (difference of -0.031, significant at
27

the 1% level), the difference becomes more pronounced after the termination of the original link
(difference of -0.33, significant at the 1% level).
Hence, our results are consistent with the notion that climate risks can drive the formation of
supply-chain relations. If suppliers are negatively impacted by climate shocks and the cost of these
shocks are shared in supply chains, managers face a financial incentive to manage the extent to
which they are indirectly exposed to climate risk. Moreover, we observe that supplier climate risk
exposure beyond expected levels increases the probability that customers switch suppliers. In line
with the notion that these switches are climate related, managers appear to identify less sensitive
supplier firms as alternatives to the original supply-chain partner.

Conclusion

In this paper, we combine temporally and spatially granular data on heatwaves and flooding from
the European Center for Medium-term Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the Darthmouth Flood
Observatory with a detailed dataset on global supply chain relationships from FactSet Revere. We
obtain a climate-supply-chain database with 4,289 (4,568) suppliers (customers) across 51 countries
around the world from 2003 to 2017, and investigate two questions: First, do climate shocks matter
financially, and do they propagate along supply chains? And second, if so, how do firms respond to
changing climate risk exposure in their supply chain networks?
We present two main insights. First, we test if climate change exposure has direct and indirect
firm performance effects due to supply chain networks. We find that the financial performance of
suppliers is negatively associated with heatwaves and flooding incidents, and show that the financial
consequences of these climate shocks propagate to customers through supply chain links. Second, we
study how firms adapt their supply-chain organizations in response to climate change risks. We find
that firms are more likely to end relationships with suppliers which experience an unexpectedly high
number of climate shocks compared to expectations formed at the beginning of the supply-chain
relationship. Moreover, in substituting these suppliers, firms diversify their supplier network and
replace high-climate-risk with lower-climate-risk suppliers.
Our results both on climate shock transmission and supply chain adaptation are economically
meaningful. For instance, we find that heatwaves and floods are associated with a subsequent
28

reduction of 4% in sales turnover and 10% in profitability at the directly affect firm, relative to
the sample median. In terms of the adaptation effects, unexpectedly high numbers of floods and
heatwaves increase the probability that customers abandon their suppliers by 4% and 1% compared
to the unconditional sample probability of a customer-supplier relationship termination of 15%.
Our finding have two important, potential implications with regard to the impact of climate
change on internationally diversified firms, and the impact of the adaptation efforts of these firms on
international economic development. First, while developing countries are likely to experience the
most pronounced increases in climate shocks, the results on the indirect impact of climate shocks
suggest that economic impact of climate change is likely to be – at least partially – shared through
economic links in global production networks. Second, if firms in high-climate risk countries are
more likely to be substituted by customers in favor of suppliers in less vulnerable locations, the
outlined effects could further economically weaken the areas most vulnerable to climate change.
Our study contributes to the rapidly growing academic literature on the financial impact of
climate change, and is among the first studies to provide evidence on how firms adapt to climate
change.

Table 3: Climate Shocks and Supplier Firm Performance
Notes. This Table presents OLS regression estimates on the impact of climate shocks in the location of the sample
supplier firms on their revenues (Rev) and operating income (OpI), both scaled by assets. Heatwave (t) and F lood (t)
are dummy variables indicating the occurrence of a climate shock in quarter t, respectively. Panel A shows the results
for contemporaneous climate shocks observed during financial quarter t, Panel B includes three additional climate
lags. The number of observations refers to supplier firm-quarters, and the sample period is 2000 to 2017. We apply
similar data filters as in Table 2a. All regressions include firm-by-quarter fixed effects to control for time invariant
firm characteristics and firm-specific seasonal effects, and industry-by-year-by-quarter fixed effects. Columns (2), (4),
(6), and (8) additionally include interaction terms of terciles of firm size, age, and ROA with year-by-quarter fixed
effects to control for firm characteristics (BS2016 FE), following Barrot and Sauvagnat (2016). Standard errors are
clustered on the firm level. ∗ , ∗∗ and ∗∗∗ indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% level, respectively.

Table 4: Downstream Propagation of Climate Shocks
Notes. This table presents OLS regression estimates on the impact of climate shocks at the supplier location on
revenues over assets (Rev) and operating income over assets (OpI) of their respective customers. In Panel A the
unit of observation is at the supplier-customer pair-quarter level. In Panel B we collapse the data at the customer
level by aggregating across suppliers. The climate shock dummy variables take the value of one if at least one
supplier has been affected by a heatwave or a flood, respectively. Hence, the number of observations in Panel B
refers to customer firm-quarters. The sample period in both panels is from 2003 to 2017. Sup Heatwave (t) and
Sup F lood (t) are dummy variables indicating the occurrence of a climate shock at the location of the supplier firm.
We apply similar data filters as in Table 3. All regressions include relationship-by-quarter fixed effects (Panel A) and
customer-by-quarter fixed effects (Panel B), respectively, as well as year-by-quarter fixed effects. Columns (2), (4),
(6), and (8) additionally include terciles of size, age, and ROA interacted with year-by-quarter fixed effects (BS2016
FE) as in Table 3. Standard errors are clustered on the customer-supplier relationship level. ∗ , ∗∗ and ∗∗∗ indicate
statistical significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% level, respectively.

Table 5: Downstream Propagation – Placebo Tests
Notes. This table presents the results of placebo tests on the impact of climate shocks at the supplier location on
customer revenues over assets (Rev) and operating income over assets (OpI). We construct the placebo sample by
restricting the observations to real customer-supplier pairs during periods in which the relationship was not yet or
no longer active. We apply similar data filters as in Table 4. Heatwave (t) and F lood (t) are dummies indicating
the occurrence of a climate shock in period t. In Panel A, the number of observations refers to supplier-customer
pair-quarters. In Panel B, we collapse the data in a similar way as in Panel B of Table 4. The sample period
in both panels is from 2003 to 2017. All regressions include relationship-by-quarter fixed effects (Panel A) and
customer-by-quarter fixed effects (Panel B), respectively, as well as year-by-quarter fixed effects. Columns (2), (4),
(6), and (8) additionally include terciles of size, age, and ROA interacted with year-by-quarter fixed effects (BS2016
FE) as in Table 4. Standard errors are clustered on the customer-supplier relationship level. ∗ , ∗∗ and ∗∗∗ indicate
statistical significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% level, respectively.

Table 6: Expected vs. Realized Climate Risk and Relationship Termination
Notes. This table presents linear probability model estimates on the impact of realized vs. expected supplier-firm
climate shocks on the likelihood of supply-chain relationship termination. Panel A reports the results for heatwaves,
Panel B reports the results for flooding incidents. The unit of observation in all regressions is at the supplier-customer
pair-year level, the dependent variable is a dummy variable taking the value of one if a given supplier-customer relationship ends after the current year t, and zero otherwise. The regressions include only pair-years in which the relationship
was active. Our main variable of interest is the indicator variable 1 (Realized > Expected Climate Shocks) (t),
capturing the deviation of realized from expected supplier climate. It is constructed by first estimating the expected
number of climate shocks per year in the supplier location over a benchmark period of five years before the establishment a given supplier-customer relationship. 1 (Realized > Expected Climate Shocks) (t) then takes the value
of one in year t if the difference between the realized number of climate shocks per year since the beginning of the
supplier-customer relationship exceeds the corresponding expected number of shocks, and zero otherwise. We exclude
customers headquartered within a 500 kilometer radius of the supplier and apply similar data filters as in Table 4.
The regressions include relationship fixed effects, year fixed effects, supplier-industry-by-year, supplier-country-by-year,
and supplier-country-by-customer-country-by-year fixed effects as indicated. Robust standard errors are clustered on
the relationship level. ∗ , ∗∗ and ∗∗∗ indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% level, respectively.

Notes. This table presents linear probability model estimates on the of realized supplier-firm climate shocks on the
likelihood of supply-chain relationship termination. Panel A reports the results for heatwaves, Panel B reports the
results for flooding incidents. Heatwave (t) and F lood (t) are dummy variables indicating the occurrence of a climate
shock in the location of the supplier firm in year t, respectively. The unit of observation is at the supplier-customer-year
level. We include only active supply-chain relationship years. The dependent variable takes the value of one if a
given supplier-customer relationship ends after the current year t, and zero otherwise. Similar to Table 6, we exclude
all customers located within 500 kilometers of their supplier and apply similar data filters as in Table 6. The
regressions include relationship fixed effects, year fixed effects, supplier-industry-by-year, supplier-country-by-year,
and supplier-country-by-customer-country-by-year fixed effects as indicated. Robust standard errors are clustered on
the relationship level. ∗ , ∗∗ and ∗∗∗ indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% level, respectively.

Table 8: Climate Change Risk and Supplier Substitution
Notes. This table reports the difference in climate change exposure between terminated suppliers and their subsequent
replacements. To construct the sample for this table, we match each supplier firm for which the supplier-customer
relationship is terminated during the sample period (“old suppliers”) (as reported in Table 6) with their replacements
(“new suppliers”). Replacement suppliers are identified as those firms with identical 4-digit SIC codes as the “old
suppliers”, which enter a new supply-chain relationship with a given customer within two years of the previous
supply-chain relationship termination. Panel A shows the comparison for heatwave exposure, Panel B shows the
results for flood exposure. The first line in each panel compares the number of climate shocks over the period from
1984 to 2017, the second line compares the exposure during the period in which the “old” supply-chain relationship
was active, and the third line refers to the time period after the “old” relationship is abandoned. t-statistics are
reported in brackets. ∗ , ∗∗ and ∗∗∗ indicate statistical significance at the 5%, 1% and 0.1% level, respectively.

Table A1: Robustness – Climate Shocks and Supplier Firm Performance

Notes. This table presents OLS regression estimates on the impact of climate shocks in the location of the sample
supplier firms on their revenues (Rev) and operating income (OpI), both scaled by assets. Heatwaves (t) and
F loods (t) are continuous variables measuring the total number (count) of climate shocks in the supplier’s location in
quarter t. Panel A shows the results for contemporaneous climate shocks observed during financial quarter t, Panel B
includes three additional climate lags. The number of observations refers to supplier firm-quarters, and the sample
period is 2000 to 2017. We apply similar data filters as in Table 2a. All regressions include firm-by-quarter fixed effects
to control for time invariant firm characteristics and firm-specific seasonal effects, and industry-by-year-by-quarter
fixed effects. Columns (2), (4), (6), and (8) additionally include interaction terms of terciles of firm size, age, and ROA
with year-by-quarter fixed effects to control for firm characteristics (BS2016 FE), following Barrot and Sauvagnat
(2016). Standard errors are clustered on the firm level. ∗ , ∗∗ and ∗∗∗ indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%
and 1% level, respectively.

Table A5: Robustness – Expected vs. Realized Climate Risk
Notes. This table presents linear probability model estimates on the impact of realized vs. expected supplierfirm climate shocks on the likelihood of supply-chain relationship termination. The sample and variables are
constructed similarly as in Table 6. In Panels A, B, and C we use benchmark periods of seven, ten, and fifteen years before the establishment of a supply-chain relationship to construct our main variables of interest,
1 (Realized > Expected Climate Shocks) (t), as illustrated in Figure 3. We apply similar data filters as in Table 6.
The regressions include relationship fixed effects, year fixed effects, supplier-industry-by-year, supplier-country-by-year,
and supplier-country-by-customer-country-by-year fixed effects as indicated. Robust standard errors are clustered on

Table A6: Robustness – Expected vs. Realized Climate Risk with Control Variables
Notes. This table presents linear probability model estimates on the impact of realized vs. expected supplier-firm
climate shocks on the likelihood of supply-chain relationship termination, controlling for supplier and customer
firm characteristics. The sample and variables are constructed similarly as in Table 6. In Panels A, B, and C
we use benchmark periods of seven, ten, and fifteen years before the establishment of a supply-chain relationship
to construct our main variables of interest, 1 (Realized > Expected Climate Shocks) (t), as illustrated in Figure
3. We apply similar data filters as in Table 6. The regressions include relationship fixed effects, year fixed effects,
supplier-industry-by-year, supplier-country-by-year, and supplier-country-by-customer-country-by-year fixed effects as
indicated. Robust standard errors are clustered on the relationship level. ∗ , ∗∗ and ∗∗∗ indicate statistical significance
at the 10%, 5% and 1% level, respectively.
