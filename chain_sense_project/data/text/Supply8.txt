Modelling the impact of climate change risk on supply chain
performance
Abstract
Climate change is among the top global risks due to its growing adverse impact on businesses.
However, few empirical studies address this imminent risk from a supply chain perspective.
Due to a lack of established approaches for capturing complex interaction between climate
change risk and supply chain performance, a three-phase mixed methodology approach was
attempted. A cognitive map first captured the inter-relationships based on a mental model
established by a group of experts. Later, a survey gathered from industry practitioners assessing
causal relationships identified key climate change factors and most influenced supply chain
performance dimensions. Finally, a system dynamics model supported by multiple case
scenarios assessed the implications of climate change on supply chain performance. The results
indicated a significant reduction in the availability of natural resources/raw material and
capacity, leading to increase in stock-outs, inventory costs and bottlenecks disrupting
procurement, manufacturing and logistics functions. Supply chain performance captured
through efficiency and effectiveness shows a negative trend with increasing climate change
consequences. The systems approach followed in this paper contributes by providing a
quantitative model for assessing the impact of climate change risk on supply chain
performance.

1. Introduction
Climate change is an inevitable risk faced by today’s supply chains. Climate change and supply
chains are found to mutually influence each other through natural disasters and greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions, respectively (Ghadge et al., 2020). Recent literature on supply chain
management attempts to capture the impact of SC operations on climate change (e.g., Sousa
Jabbour et al., 2018; Dahlmann and Roehrich, 2019). However, climate change also affects SC
operations in multiple ways. Various industries such as agriculture, forestry and mining are
exposed to the direct and indirect impact of climate change (Sussman and Freed, 2008;

Er-Kara, M., Ghadge, A. & Bititci, US, (2020), “Modelling the impact of climate change risk on supply chain
performance”, International journal of Production Research, Accepted.

Gasbarro et al., 2017). Overconsumption of these natural resources has led to the escalation of
climate change. This exogenous risk can significantly impact organisation’s operational and
financial performance (Agrawala et al., 2011; Bergmann et al., 2016; Lim-Camacho et al.,
2017). Existing climate models indicate that climate change and its cascading effects will
continue to impact global supply chains in the future (OECD, 2015, Andreoni and Miola, 2014;
Li et al., 2019). Thus, organisations should work together to develop climate resilient Supply
Chain (SC) networks. To build such capability within SCs, comprehensive understanding of
mutually-influencing relationship and their impact is essential.
Climate change impacts various entities and functional levels in supply chains, and their
ripple effect leads to risk propagation along the entire SC network (Ghadge et al., 2020).
However, investigation of the implications of climate change from SC perspective is limited
and in its early stages (Fleming et al., 2014; Alves et al., 2017; Lim-Camacho et al., 2017).
Despite few conceptual or theoretical developments, there is an evident lack of
empirical/analytical studies attempting to capture the holistic interaction between climaterelated risks and SC operations (Ghadge et al., 2020). In general, studies attempting to quantify
the impact of climate change are inadequate due to the high inherent uncertainty of the topic,
lack of suitable data, and complexity in modelling an uncertain problem (Andreoni and Miola,
2014; Melkonyan et al., 2017).
The motivation behind this study is the lack of holistic analytical modelling approaches
to develop climate change scenarios at the SC level, earlier identified by Ghadge et al. (2020).
According to Alves et al. (2017), controlling and monitoring climate contingencies at the SC
level should be permanent and systematic. This requires developing a thorough understanding
of the direct and immediate impact of climate change as well as long-term, cascading effects
resulting from the climate variability. Analysing these changes on SC performance indicators
is a good starting point to measure and assess these direct and cascading effects. Thus, this
study aims to quantify the impact of climate change risk on SC performance. In order to
achieve this aim, the study models the aggregated impact of this risk on identified SC
performance metrics as well as overall SC efficiency and effectiveness.
Due to a lack of established approaches for capturing complex interaction between
climate change risk and supply chain performance, a three-phase mixed methodology approach
was attempted. First, cognitive mapping was used to provide a graphical representation of
expert(s) mental model concerning the relations between climate change and business

Er-Kara, M., Ghadge, A. & Bititci, US, (2020), “Modelling the impact of climate change risk on supply chain
performance”, International journal of Production Research, Accepted.

operations. Consequently, a survey was developed to gather information about the most
influencing variables interfacing between climate change and SC operations from an industry
practitioners’ perspective. The prominent relations identified from the above methods were
modelled and simulated using System Dynamics (SD) approach. Multiple case scenarios with
different risk exposure levels were assessed to gain insights into the behaviour of supply chains
under different climate change scenarios.
The paper contributes to climate change risk research within the SC context in two
ways. First, the proposed cognitive map captures the complex interaction between two domains
from the climate change perspective. Past studies have looked at this from the SC perspective.
Secondly, to the best of authors’ knowledge this is the first comprehensive study attempting to
quantify the aggregated impact of climate change risk on overall SC performance, efficiency
and effectiveness.
The rest of the paper is presented as provided. Section 2 provides critical literature
associated with the impact of climate change on business operations and supply chain
performance measurement. The mixed-methodology approach is presented in section 3.
Section 4 explains the three phases of the study, from holistic cognitive mapping to the
specified quantitative analysis. Section 5 summarises the results and findings of the developed
SD model. Finally, discussion, theoretical implications and future research directions are
presented.

2. Literature review
2.1. Impact of climate change on business operations
Climate-related risks are increasingly threatening the sustainability and competitiveness of
organisations and their wider networks (Fleming et al., 2014; Bergmann et al., 2016; Gasbarro
et al., 2017). It is well known that climate change leads to rising temperatures, changes in
seasons, sea-level rise, unusual weather events and natural disasters. These events may directly
or indirectly affect multiple entities within SC networks such as physical infrastructure and
assets (e.g., factory, warehouse, energy infrastructure, transportation network), natural
resources (e.g., land, water and energy resources, crops, livestock) and workforce (OECD,
2015). To comprehend all possible impact of climate change on business operations, an
extensive review of literature was conducted. Table 1 captures a wide range of adverse effects

Er-Kara, M., Ghadge, A. & Bititci, US, (2020), “Modelling the impact of climate change risk on supply chain
performance”, International journal of Production Research, Accepted.

of climate change on the performance and competitiveness of organizations. Captured
implications from multiple sources (cited in Table 1) range from decreased availability and
quality of resources, decreased labour productivity, decline in revenue and profit, increased
effort and costs due to new regulations, increased insurance costs and changes in energy
demand for cooling and heating. Undoubtedly, climate change risk is of growing interest to
business/SC researchers as well as practitioners due to the increased frequency, severity and
duration of extreme weather events (e.g., heatwaves, floods, storms, and droughts) (OECD,
2015; Bergmann et al., 2016; Ghadge et al., 2020). Extreme events driven by climate change
are found to damage facilities, physical assets, transportation and energy infrastructure and
communication systems as evidenced from the literature (Table 1).
There have been few developments on building conceptual or theoretical underpinning.
Bergmann et al. (2016) employ comparative analysis to investigate the impact of five types of
extreme weather events (heatwave, cold wave, heavy precipitation, storm and drought) on the
financial performance of organisations based on natural resource dependence theory.
Following contingency theory, Alves et al. (2017) list four contingencies arising from climate
change that affect supply chains as: resource scarcity and difficulty of access to raw materials,
technological advances, new regulations, and extra costs. Ghadge et al. (2020) emphasise the
importance of risk management to cope with climate change following systems theory to
propose a conceptual framework for managing climate change risks in supply chains.
Despite these sporadic conceptual or theoretical developments on climate change in SC
context, there is an evident lack of empirical/analytical studies that reveal the holistic
interaction between climate-related risks and SC performance. Notably, there is an apparent
need to quantify various impacts of climate change on different stages of SCs and provide a
clear picture of this uncertain and multi-faceted interaction.
2.2. Supply chain performance measurement
Performance measurement is the process of developing a set of performance metrics and
collecting, analysing, reporting and reviewing performance data to quantify the effectiveness
and efficiency of organisations' processes (Bititci, 2015; Bourne et al., 2018). Effectiveness
indicates the level to which the customer's requirements are met; whereas efficiency refers to
how economically the resources are deployed to fulfil customer orders (Neely et al., 1995).
Performance measurement helps to ascertain that an organisation effectively reveals whether
processes are under control and whether improvements are required (Akyuz and Erkan, 2010).

Performance measurement and management systems provide a wide range of advantages such
as increased performance and competitive advantage, improved visibility on processes,
standard framework for communication, tracking and documentation of performance among
others (Bourne et al., 2000; Bititci et al., 2016).
Multiple performance indicators have been proposed and used both in the academic
literature and industry. Gunasekaran and Kobu (2007), conducting a literature review on the
performance measures in logistics and SC management, identify 27 key metrics for
organisations. Some of these financial and nonfinancial metrics are as follows: return on
investment, forecasting accuracy, labour efficiency, capacity utilisation, production flexibility,
lead time, delivery reliability, value-added, perceived quality, etc. Various performance
measurement models and frameworks have also been developed in the literature; e.g., balanced
scorecard and supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model (Akyuz and Erkan, 2010;
Bititci, 2015). Due to criticism of incomplete and incoherent performance metrics, the SCOR
model was developed by the Supply Chain Council (SCC, 2012). The SCOR model provides
a framework to describe and analyse all business processes in a standardised way across
multiple industries. It provides a set of indicators to measure, monitor and benchmark the
performance of specific process or the overall SC, based on five main performance attributes:
reliability, responsiveness, agility, costs, and asset management (Sellitto et al., 2015).
A myriad of macro and micro risks affect the inputs, processes and outputs of
organizations, damaging overall SC performance (Quang and Hara, 2018; Turken et al., 2020;
González-Zapatero et al., 2020). However, there is a lack of conceptual models linking SC risk
management and performance management domains.

3. Research methodology
This study uses a mixed methods approach to investigate the cascading effects of climate
change risk on the performance of supply chains. As the research is trying to understand
uncertain interactions between climate change and supply chains, a systems theory was
identified to be suitable. Systems theory suggests that all phenomena can be viewed as a ‘web
of relationships' that have common patterns, behaviours, and properties like a ‘system' (

Er-Kara, M., Ghadge, A. & Bititci, US, (2020), “Modelling the impact of climate change risk on supply chain
performance”, International journal of Production Research, Accepted.

Sterman, 2000). The SD approach follows systems theory to model and simulate cause and
effect relationships (Forrester, 1994; Sterman, 2000) and is found to be ideal for the nature of
study undertaken here.
Following a mixed methodology approach, the study was conducted in three phases:
•

Phase 1: A cognitive mapping approach utilised to present a holistic picture of interrelationships between climate change and SC performance management. Brainstorming
sessions with subject experts were used to develop a mental model.

•

Phase 2: A survey study to investigate awareness, perception, evaluations and experiences
of 62 managers from different industries was used to determine the most prominent risks
based on practitioner’s point of view.

•

Phase 3: Development of a SD model to quantitatively analyse the impact of identified
climate change factors on different SC indicators as well as overall SC efficiency and
effectiveness following hypothetical case scenarios.
The three structured approaches guide towards achieving defined aim of the research. In

the first phase, expert opinions were used to develop a cognitive map capturing
interrelationships between the consequences of climate change and SC performance
dimensions. The literature review on the impact of climate change on SC performance showed
that climate change affects several entities and operations via myriad factors (Table 1).
Unfortunately, there is no established methodology to apprehend these ambiguous interactions.
Thus, we followed the cognitive mapping approach to capture complex interactions between
different (internal and external) climate change factors and SC performance metrics. ‘Cognitive
map’ is a visual representation of a mental model developed by an individual or group of
experts for a given system capturing variables, entities and causal relationships based on
available knowledge (Mital et al., 2018). Cognitive mapping has several advantages, such as
the ability to model relationships that are very complex and not known with certainty; thus,
providing the ability to combine expert knowledge and available information (Özesmi and
Özesmi, 2004).
As observed in this cognitive map (Figure 1), several climate change factors influence
SC performance indicators in multiple ways. Since it is not possible to model all climate
change-related events/risks and their impact on SC performance dimensions during SD
modelling, a second phase was introduced to carefully select only key climate-driven risks and

Er-Kara, M., Ghadge, A. & Bititci, US, (2020), “Modelling the impact of climate change risk on supply chain
performance”, International journal of Production Research, Accepted.

SC performance indicators. A survey-based study engaged with 62 managers to identify
following:
•

Impacted SC functions from the overall climate change threat

•

Key climate change factors that impact SC operations

•

Identification of critical SC performance dimensions capturing this impact

In the third phase, an SD model was developed to simulate and quantify the risk impacts on
different SC performance indicators as well as overall SC efficiency and effectiveness.
The SD approach is based on systems theory and allows to analyse the dynamic
behaviour of complex systems over time (Campuzano and Mula, 2011; Ghadge et al., 2013).
The ‘systems approach’ is beneficial to model causal relationships and dependencies in order
to simulate the overall system interaction (Bala et al., 2017). It is also used to identify policies
or examine the effectiveness of decisions following simulation of the system. It is widely used
for risk assessment comprising of different scenarios, due to its capability to simulate complex
interactions and ability to perform sensitivity analysis (Li et al., 2016; Mehrjoo and Pasek,
2016; Olivares-Aguila and ElMaraghy, 2020). SD methodology follows logical modelling
approach. First a causal loop diagram (CLD) is developed. CLD is a visual representation of
the variables, links among variables, signs of the links and the feedback loops in a problem
system. Next, stock-and-flow diagram capturing input, output and rate values are identified
from the CLD. Mathematical equations and values are defined for input/output variables in this
stage. After verification and validation of equations in the stock-and-flow diagram, the model
is prepared for the simulation run with pre-defined input parameters (Rathore et al., 2020;
Olivares-Aguila and ElMaraghy, 2020).
A traditional three-echelon SC network was modelled by considering material, cash
and information flow under uncertain climatic conditions. As a part of the SD modelling
approach, first, a causal loop diagram was drawn by incorporating the most prominent links
between climate change-related risks and SC performance indicators, as revealed from the
survey. After understanding the basic structural behaviour of the system, a stock and flow
diagram was developed to model and analyse this problem in detail. A set of equations was
assigned to describe these relationships. Model parameters and equations (Appendix A & B)
were identified based on expert knowledge, authors’ experience and several logical
assumptions due to lack of available and reliable historical data related to the impact of climate
change on SC operations. The developed SD model was run to simulate nine case scenarios

Er-Kara, M., Ghadge, A. & Bititci, US, (2020), “Modelling the impact of climate change risk on supply chain
performance”, International journal of Production Research, Accepted.

representing three different risk exposure and vulnerability levels (high, moderate, low) for
sourcing, manufacturing and delivery functions. The simulation model was developed and run
in Vensim©- a commercial, discrete-event simulation platform.

4. Analysis
4.1. Towards understanding the impact of climate change on supply chain performance
The cognitive map shown in Figure 1 was developed based on two brainstorming sessions with
subject experts to capture the links between climate change factors and SC performance. Five
subject experts with academic background in supply chain risk management (2), performance
measurement (1), climate change (1) and business management (1) identified potential
interactions between climate change factors and key SC performance indicators during the first
brainstorming session. In the second session, each expert developed their mental model and
later discussed with other experts; before finalising the cognitive map capturing several interrelationships between climate change factors and SC performance holistically, as shown in
Figure 1. Multiple influential variables from both domains were identified based the number
of arrows directed to and from a variable capturing centrality/inter-dependence.

Figure 1. Cognitive map for the interaction between climate change and SC performance
As observed in Figure 1, climate change leads to several environmental consequences
including global warming and extreme weather events such as storms, hurricanes, etc.
Especially, global warming affects a huge number of variables in the system; e.g., natural
resources, heatwaves, sea level rise, precipitation and wildfire. These consequences may also
impact and trigger other climate change risks via inherent complex relationships within the
system. All of these consequences directly or indirectly affect different performance
dimensions of SCs. As an example, global warming leads to an increase in ocean temperature,
thus contributing to the melting of ice and the rising of sea levels. Climate change also disrupts
the availability of natural resources via changes in precipitation level, droughts, and extreme
weather events. Many resource-dependent industries are directly influenced by the scarcity and
decreasing quality of raw materials. Changes in weather conditions, geographical changes and
natural disasters caused by climate change may also lead to disruption in SC facilities, changes
in labour effectiveness, variability in demand and decreases in delivery performance. These
problems and increasing costs in supply chains proliferate along the network, leading to a
decrease in productivity, profits and lead times and hence, order fulfilment. The unexpected
ways in which climate change affects both the environment and organisational conditions lead
to problems in planning and forecasting reliability. Figure 1 also captures the impact of
industrial activities on climate change. Manufacturing operations require consumption of
energy and natural resources, which may result in environmental degradation, loss of resource
bases and GHG emissions. Both manufacturing operations and transportation activities are
influenced by environmental pollution and changes in land use. Therefore, SC operations also
contribute to the growth of existing climate change issues. Thus, environmental regulations
and policies were incorporated for reducing the amount of waste and GHG emissions produced
by SCs.

4.2. Defining the boundaries of the model
The cognitive map in the previous section provided a general picture of the SCs under influence
of climate change factors. However, it is not possible to model all effects in a unique
quantitative model. Therefore, a questionnaire was designed to identify the most prominent
variables interlinking climate change and SC performance dimensions from an SC manager’s
perspective. To collect the survey data, first, introductory information was provided to
respondents about the aim of the research. Survey questions focused on evaluation of the

Er-Kara, M., Ghadge, A. & Bititci, US, (2020), “Modelling the impact of climate change risk on supply chain
performance”, International journal of Production Research, Accepted.

criticality of different climate change factors and exposure of different SC functions to these
risks.
The survey designed in the Qualtrics survey platform was shared with over 240 contacts
in industry. Email and other social media platforms such as LinkedIn and Twitter were used to
obtain responses. 62 responses (26% response rate) were collected over five months (JanuaryMay 2019) from managers from multiple industries (e.g., food, textile, automotive, electronics,
logistics, pharmaceutical, construction, machinery and energy). Targeted survey respondents
were not limited to a specific industry, with a view of providing a general overview of climate
change in the business world. Of the respondents, half were senior managers (i.e., directors and
executives); 37% and 13% were at mid-level and junior managers, respectively. Average work
experience of respondents was around 12 years. The 62 responses were checked for nonresponse bias by comparing early and late responses to reveal significant differences, if any
(Armstrong and Overton, 1997; Blome et al., 2014). All the responses were divided into two
groups based on their time of return and t-test was performed on two groups. The results of the
two-samples revealed no statistically significant difference (t=13.52, p>0.05) for all three
aspects for which data was collected. The difference between the two groups for the categories
was at the 5% level. Thus, the sample was not found to have response bias and was used for
the next level of analysis.
Unsurprisingly, 87% of the respondents stated that climate change is a significant risk
for their SC/business, which indicates a high awareness of the climate change threat in industry.
Respondents who did not think climate change poses a severe risk to their business were from
the automotive, electronics and machinery industries. First, the respondents were asked to
assess different climate change consequences based on the effect to their business based on a
five-point scale (Don’t know, No impact, Low impact, Moderate impact, High impact). Figure
2 shows the percentage of respondents providing the highest score for the negative effects of
climate change factors on the overall performance of their SC network. Based on the responses,
extreme weather events, temperature increase, deforestation and decrease in available land
were selected as the primary external factors for the SD modelling. Changes in seasons was
not included as temperature increase variability will indirectly include this effect. Detailed
examination of the responses also revealed that, due to the direct and indirect relations between
different climate change factors, the awareness and visibility of these links and their ripple
effects are relatively low; e.g., differences between respondents' individual answers on rising

performance”, International journal of Production Research, Accepted.

functions due to climate change. Activities associated with planning and forecasting and
inventory management overlap with supply and manufacturing function. Therefore, supply,
manufacturing and delivery were selected as SC functions that would be most exposed to the
negative effects of climate change driven-risks.

Respondents were also asked to assess the impact of each climate change
factor/consequence on a more detailed set of performance dimensions. These performance
dimensions namely, demand variability, availability of resources, raw material quality, raw
material price, productivity, manufacturing lead time, manufacturing cost, product quality,
warehousing/inventory holding cost, delivery lead time, delivery cost, maintenance cost,
energy consumption and disruptions of SC facilities were identified. These results were
complementary to most impacted SC functions as well as established SC performance
measurement matrices. Survey results indicated that extreme weather events and temperature
increase impact through non-availability and accessibility of resources, increase in raw material
prices and disruptions to transportation routes, further cascading into reduced overall efficiency
of SC operations.
4.3. Developing system dynamics model
The aim of this section is to develop the SD model of a three-echelon SC under the impact of
critical climate change factors.
Causal loop diagram
Only the most prominent climate change factors and most vulnerable operations to climate
change threat were identified for the development of the causal-loop model. Following the
survey results, extreme weather events and temperature increase were identified as the major
external factors for the SD model. These factors directly impact the availability of natural
resources (e.g., crops, plants and animal species, water, fossil fuel reserves) due to decreased
availability of land; further impacting the availability of raw materials in many natural
resource-dependent industries. Secondly, the impact of extreme weather conditions on delivery
performance was represented in two ways: decreased delivery speed and blockage of
transportation routes due to extreme/adverse weather events (e.g., storms, snowfall). The causal
loop diagram shown in Figure 4 represents the critical interactions between selected climate
change factors and SC dynamics. Arrows represent the causal links between different elements
of the system ("+": positive, "–": negative relationships).
As seen from Figure 4, climate change is an external factor of the system, and its
consequences directly or indirectly affect several SC performance measures such as
availability of raw materials, productivity, delivery performance, order-fulfilment rate and
customer satisfaction. Besides the impact of climate change on physical flows in SC networks,

Er-Kara, M., Ghadge, A. & Bititci, US, (2020), “Modelling the impact of climate change risk on supply chain
performance”, International journal of Production Research, Accepted.

it also leads to some economic impact for SC stakeholders. The proposed model considers two
types of costs that are impacted by the climate change; increasing raw material price due to
growing resource scarcity problems and additional logistics costs because of delivery delays
and blockage of transportation routes (e.g., higher carrying cost due to higher lead time,
inventory holding cost during blockage). Efficiency and effectiveness dimensions are
incorporated into the model to understand and evaluate the performance implications of climate
change risk in SCs.

Figure 4. Causal loop diagram for the SD model
Stock and flow diagram
The developed causal loop diagram was later converted into a stock and flow diagram with
multiple stock, flow and auxiliary variables. Figure 5 represents the stock and flow diagram of
a three-echelon SC, including supply (sourcing/procurement) and manufacturing as key subsystems and delivery functions linked with the movement of goods between them. The
objective of developing a stock and flow model was to assess changes in SC dynamics under
varying climate change conditions. Here, input and output variables of the system were defined
based on insights generated from the causal loop diagram. For more information regarding
converting the causal loop diagram to a stock and flow diagram for obtaining simulation results
in the SD, please refer to Forrester (1994) or Sterman (2000).

performance”, International journal of Production Research, Accepted.

The SD model consisting of a stock and flow diagram was based on a continuous
material flow throughout a three-echelon network. Due to lack of real-time data for simulation,
hypothetical data with several parameter values and assumptions were considered. The quantity
of monthly customer demand was assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of 1000 and
a standard deviation of 100. The model was designed such that, if the finished goods inventory
is not sufficient to fulfil a customer order, the manufacturer will face stock-out issues. Initial
inventory levels at supplier and manufacturer were set at 1200 to provide a steady state
beginning for the simulation run.
Different scenarios were developed by varying climate change related disruption levels.
Availability of raw materials, transportation blockage and bad weather-related delays were
specified as random variables. Distribution parameters (e.g. mean, standard deviation, min,
max) and parameter trend changes at different time steps were identified based on the
characteristic of the scenario type. Since SD is a behaviour-oriented simulation approach, input
values and input distributions require domain knowledge and experience (Ghadge et al., 2013).
Hence, the parameter space was explored based on multiple runs with stochastic parameters.
Parameter values and relative influence of each parameter on simulation behaviour were
discussed with two industry practitioners to qualify the best numerical values for low
(optimistic), moderate and high (pessimistic) conditions by referencing real world experiences
and foresight. Other model parameters such as standard delivery time were determined by
consulting experts about the most likely value. Appendix A and B provides detailed
information on key variables, simulation parameters and scenario parameters used in this study.
Capturing impact of climate change risk effects on availability of raw materials and supply
rate
Availability of resources is affected by disruption and found to be exponentially decreasing
due to cascading impact (Ivanov et al., 2014; Ojha et al., 2018). Availability of raw materials
was calculated with Equation (1).
!"#$%#&$%$'( *+ ,#- .#'/,$#%0
= 23$'$#% #"#$%#&%/ ,/0*4,5/ "#%4/ ∗ / !"#$%&'() "+&$,-( (..("- ∗ -&$(

(1)

Initial value of available resources was set at 1500 units (150% of mean demand).
Combined climate effect showed that the level of climate change exposure is a function of the
following variables: extreme weather events, temperature increase and decrease in available
land. The value of these three variables was determined by assigning a severity value between
1 and 9. These variables have a different level of impact on the availability of resources.

Thus, different weights were assigned to each of these factors as 0.3, 0.5 and 0.2, respectively.
The combined climate effect variable was calculated by multiplying the weighted total with an
adjustment coefficient to represent the real behaviour of the system following expert opinion
(by examining what will happen under similar conditions in the real life). Raw material price
was also set as a function of the availability of resources and the combined climate change
impact (initial value=7.5 $/unit).
Capturing impact of weather conditions on logistics
The initial value of the delivery lead time was set to seven days. Shipment of finished goods to
customers may be delayed due to changes in weather patterns and extreme weather events in
terms of increased lead time or may cause blockage of transportation infrastructure for a period.
A lead time adjustment variable was added to represent these effects. Occurrence start time and
severity of a possible transportation route blockage and weather-related delays were modelled
as random variables. Mean, standard deviation and max distribution values were adjusted based
on the state of climate change risk. In case of a route blockage or decrease in delivery speed
(e.g. in case of heavy rain or storm), the additional time taken was addressed as a delay.

The model included several performance indicators to analyse the behaviour of SC
dynamics under varying climate change conditions, e.g., manufacturing productivity change,
stock out amount, delays in delivery (logistics). Overall, system performance was calculated

Er-Kara, M., Ghadge, A. & Bititci, US, (2020), “Modelling the impact of climate change risk on supply chain
performance”, International journal of Production Research, Accepted.

based on the efficiency and effectiveness of the SC. SC efficiency was defined as a change
function of unit cost and manufacturing productivity. SC effectiveness was calculated by stockout amount, deviation in lead time and delays in delivery. An empirical input validation process
was performed to check how well the developed model corresponds to the reality (Rand and
Rust, 2011). All key parameters were calibrated via running the model for different input values
and analysing the behaviour of different system parameters with the help of SD expert and
industry practitioners. Extreme values were tested to make sure the developed SD model works
as expected. Finally, the model was accepted as representative of a traditional real-world SC
network following the results of experiments conducted.
Availability of raw materials during supply and manufacturing activities was found to
be a major bottleneck for the SC system identified earlier. Similar significant impact of climate
change was observed on the logistical disruptions. For developing case scenarios presented in
Table 2, this information was utilised along with considering three layers of severity (Low30%, Moderate-60% & High-90%). For example, the S1L2 disruption scenario represents the
low availability of raw materials with a moderate level of logistical operations for climate
change uncertainty. The physical meaning of this scenario is that there is only 30% availability
of raw materials at the supplier/manufacturer, along with 60% available capacity of logistics.
The simulation model was run for a 40-year horizon, as the accuracy of the predictions will be
inaccurate beyond this time interval due to high uncertainty concerning climate change.

5. Simulation and findings
By simulating the developed SD model, the following results were obtained. Figure 6(a) shows
the expected decrease in availability of raw materials due to the combined impact of climate
change risk on natural resources and associated ecosystems for three groups of scenarios. An
adjustment coefficient that was included in the combined climate effect formulation was varied
to develop three scenario groups with different severity levels as low, moderate and high. The
percentage decreases in the availability of raw materials were observed to be 40%, 53% and
78% for low, moderate and high impact scenarios, respectively. It is evident from Figure 6(a)
that, if SCs and governments do not take action to reduce climate change and associated risks,
the worst scenario shows that some raw materials (e.g., crops, minerals) may expeditiously
decrease and SCs may be obliged to find alternative resources.

Er-Kara, M., Ghadge, A. & Bititci, US, (2020), “Modelling the impact of climate change risk on supply chain
performance”, International journal of Production Research, Accepted.

In this study, demand was assumed to be normally distributed. However, when the
simulated impact is combined with other external factors such as growing global population
and use of natural resources, the uncontrolled effects of climate change will be much more
intense for agriculture, forestry, mining and bioenergy sectors.

Figure 6. Changes in available resources and raw material price due to combined climate
change impact
Problems associated with the availability and accessibility in raw materials were
directly reflected in the commodity prices. Figure 6(b) shows an increase in unit raw material
price due to supply problems resulting from combined climatic impact. The percentage
increases in unit price were approximately 66%, 89%, and 130% for low, moderate and high
impact on resources, respectively. Rising raw material prices and decline in the raw material
market size puts pressure on manufacturing costs, productivity, product price and revenue. For
perishable/time-sensitive products, the distribution and storage of raw materials should also be
considered, as they bear extra cost and energy consumption. Although this was not considered
in the model, with increasing global temperatures, the energy consumption of refrigerator
systems in delivery and warehousing is expected to grow exponentially.
Figure 7 represents the decrease in production rate and the increasing stock-out amount
due to supply problems resulting from the adverse impact of climate change risks. Supply
shortages and increases in raw material prices have a significant impact on manufacturing
productivity. Therefore, downward trends in productivity and manufacturing capacity should
be assessed along with other economic impacts of climate change.

performance”, International journal of Production Research, Accepted.

Figure 7. Changes in production rate and stock-out amount due to climate change
Figure 8 represents delay in delivery as a percentage of standard delivery lead time and
increase in total logistics costs as a percentage of initial standard value. These figures were
generated based on simulation of bad weather conditions and extreme weather events. As seen
in the Figure 8, frequency, severity and duration of both events are observed to be increasing.
All modes of transportation are increasingly affected by adverse weather conditions and
extreme weather events based on time, volatility and costs of operations. It is expected that
delivery performance and reliability will increase to a critical level within 40 years. This may
cause scheduling problems across the whole SC network. Increased lead time and keeping
products on hand during transportation blockages bear additional transportation, labour and
inventory holding costs.
The effects of disruption may quickly propagate throughout the whole SC network
(Ghadge et al., 2012; Scheibe and Blackhurst, 2018; Dolgui et al., 2018; Dolgui et al., 2020);
therefore, the proposed SD model considered the impact of various climate change factors on
different SC performance indicators. These impacts were combined and examined under two
main dimensions - efficiency and effectiveness; as an SC may be ineffective even though they
are efficient. Figures 9 and 10 show the changes in these variables for all the scenarios
considered in this study (initial condition=100% for both variables). It was observed that the
average decrease in the operational efficiency of the SC was higher than effectiveness in all
scenarios. A relatively higher decrease in efficiency (compared to effectiveness) is driven by a
significant decrease in resources to fulfil growing SC demand. Decreases in both SC efficiency
and effectiveness leads to a decline in the overall SC performance.

The results of the proposed SD simulation model provided a platform for quantifying
and understanding interactions between climate change risks and SC performance.

6. Discussion and theoretical implications
The developed SD model provides information on the links between climate change-related
risks and SC operations. The following prepositions can be put forward for this interaction
based on the results of study. Implications and suggestions are also provided for an effective
response under each proposition.
Proposition 1: There is a complex and strong interaction between climate change factors
and SC performance dimensions.
This study empirically reveals a high-level dynamic interaction between climate change factors
and SC performance indicators. Therefore, in our view, these two fields should be assessed
together by businesses, governments, agencies and organisations to better manage and respond
to disruptions. Practitioners and academics seem more aware of the direct and immediate
impact of climate change risk, and indirect impacts are generally neglected: e.g., long-term

Er-Kara, M., Ghadge, A. & Bititci, US, (2020), “Modelling the impact of climate change risk on supply chain
performance”, International journal of Production Research, Accepted.

availability of resources. The proposed systems theory-based approach put forward the multidimensional direct and indirect impact of climate change both in the short- and long-term.
Preposition 2: When the impact of climate change is examined at the SC level, the
cascading effect of these risks, along with overall SC performance, efficiency and
effectiveness become more apparent.
The survey shows that businesses are already feeling the effects of climate change in their
operations. However, the propagation of the combined climatic effects along the entire SC
remains overlooked. SC ecosystems are composed of multiple, complex and connected entities,
layers and activities, which make these networks inherently vulnerable to the propagative and
cascading effects of potential risks (Ghadge et al., 2020). The proposed SD analysis provides
insights into how the impacts of different climatic risks on different levels of an SC propagate
along the network and how this combined climate change effect is observed on overall SC
performance, efficiency and effectiveness.
The results of the model demonstrate the need for substantial intervention for holistic,
network-level approaches for climate change risk management systems. It should also be noted
that companies may be more susceptible to climate change-related risks via unprepared and
weak stakeholders, e.g., suppliers. Notably, global SC networks need to assess geographical
disparities in exposure to climate change carefully. Increased information sharing, visibility,
communication and reporting about climate change are some strategies that may increase
climate change resilience and adaption capabilities.
Proposition 3: There is a remarkable difference among the awareness level (and
assessments of climate change risk factors) of managers from different sectors.
Despite there being a common view concerning the growing danger of some climatic risks
(e.g., weather extremes), a significant difference is observed among managers' responses on
the assessment of the interdependency between particular climate change factors and
performance dimensions. This was an expected case as the target group was not restricted to a
specific industry, and the exposure and vulnerability of each organisation is highly dependent
on the industrial sector, geographical region and business network structure. Some sectors are
inherently more vulnerable to the climate change threat, e.g., agriculture, food and renewable
energy. However, the results reveal that climate change risk is ‘highly underrated’, and

Er-Kara, M., Ghadge, A. & Bititci, US, (2020), “Modelling the impact of climate change risk on supply chain
performance”, International journal of Production Research, Accepted.

awareness and visibility regarding the links between climate change factors and their ‘ripple
effects’ are generally overlooked.
Organisations' business model/strategies and performance management systems should
cover climate change threat to survive in today's rapidly changing and volatile climate. Both
climate change science and SC networks inherently cover myriad uncertainties and complex
relationships; therefore, there may be sudden and unpredicted changes in the system.
Especially, changing patterns of extreme events and natural disasters are increasingly linked to
climate change and associated risks. Hence, adaptability and disaster recovery planning are of
vital importance while facing climate change risk.

7. Conclusion
Following a systems perspective, this study conceptualised the interaction between climate
change risk and SC performance for assessing the impact of one over other. The study consisted
of three main phases. First, a group of experts identified potential impacts of climate change
on SCs following development of a cognitive map (Figure 1). Later, a survey was applied to a
group of practitioners to filter key climate change factors and their impact on major SC
performance dimensions. It was observed that sourcing, manufacturing and logistics are the
most vulnerable SC operations to climate change due to the combined impact of temperature
increase, decrease in available land and extreme weather events on the availability of raw
materials and resource capacity. Following the survey, in the third phase, an SD model was
developed to simulate these prominent relations and their impact on overall SC performance,
efficiency and effectiveness. The impact of climate change-driven risks was simulated under
three levels (low, moderate, and high) for both the availability of resources and delivery
performance, resulting in nine different hypothetical case scenarios. The study quantified the
impact of climate change risk on SC performance.
Climate change risk has started to transform business; however, academia has lagged
behind these developments compared to the industry. The academic literature is dominated
with research on environmentally friendly technologies and risk mitigation strategies; the
opposite perspective, the impact of climate change on business, remains highly undervalued
and underestimated. Need for empirical research to model, quantify and predict the impact of
climate change-driven risks on SCs (Ghadge et al., 2020) was an evident research gap. This

Er-Kara, M., Ghadge, A. & Bititci, US, (2020), “Modelling the impact of climate change risk on supply chain
performance”, International journal of Production Research, Accepted.

study is believed to bridge the gap through the integration of supply chain risk management
and performance management concepts. Limited number of studies have focussed on the
integration of risk management and performance measurement within supply chain context
(e.g. Kache and Seuring, 2014; Chaudhuri et al., 2020). This study reveals the importance of
incorporating risk management into organization’s list of performance measures for effective
supply chain management. This helps organizations as well as SCs to be better prepared for
uncertain crises or disruptions.
This study contributes to the literature in three key dimensions. First, this study
conceptualises and investigates the uncertain interaction between climate change and SC
performance based on a review of relevant literature and the development of a cognitive map.
The originality of this research resides in bringing together climate change inputs and
behaviour of SC dynamics within an SC performance measurement perspective. The proposed
systems approach-based structure offers a deeper understanding and holistic picture of the
relationship between climate change factors and SC performance dimensions. Second, it
provides an SD-based model to quantify the implications of climate change risk on supply
chain performance, efficiency and effectiveness. Such quantitative analysis facilitates and
enhances our knowledge and understanding of the cascading propagation mechanism of
climate change risk across supply chain networks. A systems theory approach helps to improve
the visibility of climate change-related risks and SD methodology provides a platform to
investigate the changes in performance under changing climatic conditions. Third, although
there is a growing awareness of the impact on climate change and global warming on business
operations, its generalisability for overall SC performance has not been addressed in the
literature. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is novel by providing a
comprehensive, quantitative, systems theory-based assessment for capturing interrelationship
between two key mutually-influencing areas. The authors expect this article to be a steppingstone for further research and providing a new perspective for performance management in
developing climate-smart and adaptable SCs.
The study also provides a few propositions and managerial implications. First, insights
generated on the most influential climate change factors and most influenced SC functions will
help SC managers to better plan for climate change risk management. Assessment results show
the extent of implications on key SC performance matrices. This information is vital for
performance measurement and management. Furthermore, 'closed-loop' causal relationship

Er-Kara, M., Ghadge, A. & Bititci, US, (2020), “Modelling the impact of climate change risk on supply chain
performance”, International journal of Production Research, Accepted.

evidenced between climate change and supply chain will encourage practitioners to be more
considerate towards the environment. This systems-theory driven holistic study is expected to
encourage SCs/businesses in making proactive investments in order to mitigate climate-change
related future disruptions.
The study has some limitations. The relationship between climate change and SC
performance is multi-fold and covers a wide range of factors that increase the complexity of
the problem. Future study can explore this intricate relationship following a micro-level
analysis. It should also be noted that, scientific evidence shows that climate change is
accelerating fast; hence, firms must develop robust assessment capabilities to manage this
inevitable risk better. Taking a clue from this study, similar empirical and quantitative studies
on climate change should be undertaken to develop comprehensive understanding of cascading
effect on wider supply chain ecosystem. Future studies should also focus on developing robust
risk mitigation strategies to quickly reduce and possibly overcome the impact of climate risk
on global supply chains. Each business within network needs to build resilience to the growing
climate change risk and its cascading impact on the wider SC network (Ivanov et al., 2017;
Dolgui et al., 2018). Although the SD model has some limitations and assumptions in terms of
the boundaries of the model and included variables; the results of the study are presented by
considering the current state of the global markets and different sectoral characteristics to
overcome some of these weaknesses. In the simulation model, the scope of climate change
impact was limited only to factors and interrelationships identified in the survey. Another major
limitation of the study is the difficulty to gather and utilise historical data on the impact of
climate change on SC operations, as quantification of this relationship is complex and equally
difficult. Additional data from different sources (e.g. meteorological data) could be used in
future studies to better understand the implications of climate risk on supply chain
performance. Despite the above limitations, this study helps to model complicated relationships
and thus improve the understanding of the effects of climate change risk on overall SC
performance.
